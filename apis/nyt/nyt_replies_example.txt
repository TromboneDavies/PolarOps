["@MacDougle Donald Trump wasn't an eloquent speaker and he most certainly didn't have the credentials for the job.", "@MacDougle\n\nIt's poor indeed to make such as statement and not defend it because it's not obviously true as it was with Trump. But using Trump as an example, let me show you how to support a statement:\n\nTrump is a terrible speaker and doesn't have the  credentials for the job. He insulted Senator John McCain, saying he's no hero because he was captured. The first special ops mission he authorized went badly. A US Navy SEAL was killed and about a dozen innocent civilians died in a crossfire. When asked, Trump said the generals briefed me and THEY lost him. As Commander-in-Chief, he's always responsible. After a photo op with military leaders, he said, \"Maybe this is the calm before the storm.\" It's unconscionable as the leader of the most lethal military power in human history to make such a comment. At his rallies, Trump lies and speaks ad nauseam. Like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un.\n\nI could go on and on and on but I think you get the idea. I can guarantee VP Harris will never sink to such depths.\n\nNow that's how you support a statement.", "@Kay Bee, I had wanted to serve my country but as a lesbian I wasn't going to go near the armed forces.  Not with the way things were back in the latter part of the 20th century.", "@atb Yes--let's fix the system by PAYING TEACHERS!", "@Cary \nAnd a good honest journalist wouldn't have written it in the first place!!!", "@Jamie Nichols \nSo how long under current circumstances do you think anyone other that the \"Trumpites\" will consider this country \"great.\""]
