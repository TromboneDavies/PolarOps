Veronica has been doing Ph.D.-level research work with me over the last ten
months, and we are very excited to submit our first written work to the IC2S2
research community. IC2S2 is one of the most prestigious (probably *the* most
prestigious) annual gatherings of scholars in the interdisciplinary field of
Computational Social Science. Their double-blind review process is extremely
rigorous, but if our submission is accepted, going to Chicago to present the
work and network with big names in the field would be a formative, even
game-changing, experience for Veronica.
