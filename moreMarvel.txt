I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

  
This is crazy. What did I do?

  
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

  
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

  
We can talk, sir.

  
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

  
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

  
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

  
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

  
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

  
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

  
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

  
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

  
Is it true you went 12 for with last year's Maxim cover models?

  
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

  
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

  
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

  
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

  
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

  
All right.

  
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

  
Please, no gang signs.

  
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

  
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

  
Come on. Hurry up.
Just click it. Don't change any settings.

  
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

  
What have we got?

  
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

  
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

  
Son of a bitch!

  
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

  
Whoa!

  
Tony Stark.

  
Visionary. Genius.

  
American patriot.

  
Even from an early age,

  
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

  
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

  
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

  
At age six, his first engine.

  
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

  
Then, the passing of a titan.

  
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

  
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

  
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

  
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

  
With the keys to the kingdom,

  
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

  
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

  
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

  
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

  
and her interests around the globe.

  
As liaison to Stark Industries,

  
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

  
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

  
to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

  
Tony?

  
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

  
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

  
This is wonderful.

  
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

  
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

  
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

  
Tony, you know...

  
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

  
He's always working.

  
Work it! Come on!

  
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

  
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

  
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

  
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

  
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

  
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

  
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

  
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

  
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

  
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

  
I don't have any of those
floating around.

  
We're gonna let it ride!

  
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

  
Okay, you, too.

  
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

  
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

  
Two craps. Line away.

  
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

  
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, William.

  
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

  
Tomorrow, don't be late.

  
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

  
I know, I know.

  
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

  
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

  
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

  
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

  
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

  
- Hi.
- Hi.

  
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

  
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

  
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

  
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

  
"The Merchant of Death"?

  
That's not bad.

  
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

  
Well, Ms. Brown,

  
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

  
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

  
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

  
Rehearse that much?

  
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

  
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

  
All I want is a serious answer.

  
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

  
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

  
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

  
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

  
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

  
would call that being a hero.

  
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

  
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

  
by advancing medical technology

  
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

  
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

  
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

  
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

  
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

  
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

  
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

  
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

  
Tony?

  
Hey, Tony?

  
You are not authorized
to access this area.

  
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

  
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

  
and there's a car waiting for you outside

  
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

  
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

  
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

  
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

  
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

  
Will that be all?

  
Give me an exploded view.

  
The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

  
Log that.

  
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

  
I'll keep you posted.

  
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

  
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

  
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

  
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

  
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

  
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

  
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

  
before I get you out of the door.

  
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

  
if it departs before you arrive?

  
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

  
Do you want it? Yes or no.

  
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

  
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

  
where he lived and worked,

  
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

  
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

  
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

  
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

  
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

  
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

  
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

  
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

  
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

  
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

  
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

  
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

  
I knew that. Already?

  
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

  
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

  
- And?
- It was very nice.

  
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

  
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

  
Okay.

  
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

  
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

  
I got you. I got you.

  
What's wrong with you?

  
- What?
- Three hours.

  
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

  
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

  
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

  
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

  
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

  
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

  
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

  
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

  
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

  
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

  
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

  
You don't respect yourself,

  
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

  
I'm just your babysitter.

  
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

  
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

  
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

  
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

  
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

  
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

  
incapable of being responsible.

  
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

  
Hot sake?

  
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

  
That's what I'm talking about.

  
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

  
you know what I recognize?

  
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

  
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

  
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

  
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

  
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

  
General.

  
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

  
Thanks.

  
Is it better to be feared or respected?

  
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

  
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

  
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

  
It's the first missile system

  
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

  
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

  
I respectfully disagree.

  
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

  
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

  
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

  
Find an excuse

  
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

  
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

  
For your consideration, the Jericho.

  
I'll be throwing one of these in

  
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

  
To peace!

  
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

  
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

  
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

  
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

  
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

  
Good night, Tony.

  
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

  
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

  
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

  
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

  
What the hell did you do to me?

  
What I did?

  
What I did is to save your life.

  
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

  
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

  
Here, want to see?

  
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

  
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

  
We call them the walking dead

  
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

  
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

  
hooked up to a car battery,

  
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

  
That's right. Smile.

  
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

  
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

  
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

  
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

  
Where are we?

  
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

  
Just do as I do.

  
Come on, put your hands up.

  
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

  
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

  
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

  
"in the history of America."

  
He is honored.

  
He wants you to build the missile.

  
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

  
This one.

  
I refuse.

  
Tony!

  
He wants to know what you think.

  
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

  
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

  
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

  
He says for you
to start working immediately,

  
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

  
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

  
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

  
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

  
Look, what you just saw,

  
that is your legacy, Stark.

  
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

  
Is that how you want to go out?

  
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

  
Or are you going to
do something about it?

  
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

  
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

  
Well, then,

  
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

  
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

  
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

  
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

  
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

  
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

  
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

  
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

  
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

  
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

  
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

  
You know, we might be more productive

  
if you include me
in the planning process.

  
Okay, we don't need this.

  
What is that?

  
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

  
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

  
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

  
Relax. I have steady hands.

  
Why do you think you're still alive?

  
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

  
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

  
Nice to meet you, too.

  
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

  
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

  
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

  
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

  
But what could it generate?

  
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

  
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

  
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

  
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

  
Flatten them out and look.

  
Oh, wow.

  
Impressive.

  
Good.

  
Good roll. Good roll.

  
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

  
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

  
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

  
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

  
And you, Stark?

  
- No.
- No?

  
So you're a man who has everything

  
and nothing.

  
Relax.

  
The bow and arrow

  
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

  
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

  
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

  
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

  
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

  
But today,

  
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

  
rules these lands.

  
And soon,

  
it will be my turn.

  
What does he want?

  
What do you want? A delivery date?

  
I need him.

  
Good assistant.

  
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

  
Okay? Can you move?

  
Okay, say it again.

  
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

  
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

  
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

  
Say something.
Say something back to him.

  
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

  
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

  
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

  
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

  
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

  
Okay.

  
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

  
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

  
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

  
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

  
- I have it.
- Press Control "l".

  
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."

  
Come over here and button me up.

  
Okay. All right.

  
Every other hex bolt.

  
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

  
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

  
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

  
We need more time.

  
Hey,

  
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

  
Stick to the plan!

  
Yinsen!

  
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

  
Stark.

  
Come on. We got to go.

  
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

  
This was always the plan, Stark.

  
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

  
My family is dead.

  
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

  
It's okay.

  
I want this. I want this.

  
Thank you for saving me.

  
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

  
My turn.

  
Not bad.

  
Hey!

  
How was the "fun-vee"?

  
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

  
Watch it, coming up here.

  
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

  
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

  
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

  
Where to, sir?

  
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

  
No? Tony, you have to

  
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

  
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

  
I've been in captivity for three months.

  
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

  
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

  
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

  
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

  
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

  
Look at this!

  
Tony.

  
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

  
Look at you!

  
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

  
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

  
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

  
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

  
Can I speak to you for a moment?

  
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

  
I'm not a reporter.

  
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

  
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

  
and Logistics Division.

  
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

  
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

  
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

  
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

  
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

  
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

  
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

  
A little less formal and...

  
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

  
I don't know what he's up to.

  
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

  
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

  
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

  
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

  
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

  
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

  
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

  
I saw young Americans killed

  
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

  
And I saw

  
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

  
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

  
What happened over there?

  
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

  
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

  
And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

  
the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

  
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

  
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

  
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

  
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

  
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

  
And he's healthier than ever.

  
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

  
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

  
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

  
Well, that... That went well.

  
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

  
Your head? What about my head?

  
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

  
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

  
Yep.

  
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

  
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

  
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

  
It's my name on the side of the building.

  
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

  
Not based on what I saw.

  
We're not doing a good enough job.

  
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

  
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

  
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

  
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

  
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

  
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

  
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

  
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

  
Maybe.

  
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

  
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

  
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

  
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

  
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

  
- Okay.
- Okay?

  
It works.

  
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

  
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

  
like your father and I.

  
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

  
- But if I had...
- Tony.

  
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

  
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

  
You gotta let me handle this.

  
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

  
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

  
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

  
Stark Industries!

  
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

  
Sell, sell, sell!

  
Abandon ship!

  
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

  
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

  
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

  
Pepper. How big are your hands?

  
- What?
- How big are your hands?

  
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

  
Hey.

  
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

  
Let's see them.

  
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

  
I just need your help for a sec.

  
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

  
It was. It is now an antique.

  
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

  
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

  
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

  
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

  
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

  
It's fine.

  
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

  
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

  
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

  
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

  
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

  
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

  
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

  
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

  
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

  
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

  
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

  
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

  
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

  
Okay.

  
Oh, there's pus!

  
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

  
- not from my body.
- It smells!

  
Yeah, it does.

  
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

  
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

  
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

  
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

  
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

  
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

  
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

  
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

  
What's wrong?

  
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

  
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

  
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

  
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

  
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

  
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

  
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

  
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

  
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

  
Nice.

  
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

  
You okay?

  
Don't ever, ever, ever,

  
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

  
I don't have anyone but you.

  
Anyway...

  
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

  
Destroy it.

  
Incinerate it.

  
You don't want to keep it?

  
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

  
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

  
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

  
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

  
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

  
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

  
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

  
I'll tell you, in my experience,

  
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

  
his insight,

  
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

  
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

  
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

  
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

  
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

  
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

  
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

  
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

  
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

  
- Was it lvan?
- Don't do that.

  
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

  
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

  
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

  
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

  
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

  
I'm doing a little better than walking.

  
- Really?
- Yeah.

  
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

  
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

  
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

  
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

  
that was a doozy.

  
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

  
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

  
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

  
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

  
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

  
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

  
Thanks.

  
- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

  
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark Two.

  
Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

  
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

  
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

  
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

  
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

  
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

  
Next. Up.

  
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

  
Stay put. Nice.

  
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

  
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

  
Up.

  
Screw it. Don't even move.

  
You are a tragedy.

  
Okay, let's do this right.

  
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

  
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

  
You, roll it.

  
Okay. Activate hand controls.

  
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

  
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

  
And three,

  
two,

  
one.

  
Up two. All right, set that.

  
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

  
Yeah, everything's... What?

  
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

  
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

  
Okay.

  
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

  
It is.

  
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

  
I didn't expect that.

  
How'd it go?

  
It went that bad, huh?

  
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

  
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

  
It would have gone better
if you were there.

  
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

  
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

  
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

  
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

  
They're filing an injunction.

  
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

  
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

  
We knew that was gonna happen.

  
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

  
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

  
Tony, the board has rights, too.

  
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

  
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

  
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

  
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

  
This is great.

  
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

  
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

  
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

  
Something to pitch them.

  
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

  
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

  
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

  
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

  
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

  
- Take two.
- Thank you.

  
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

  
Good night, Obie.

  
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

  
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

  
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

  
All right, nice and easy.

  
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

  
And three, two, one.

  
Okay.

  
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

  
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

  
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

  
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

  
Three, two, one.

  
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

  
Not the car, not the car!

  
Table!

  
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

  
No!

  
Yeah, I can fly.

  
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

  
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

  
Import all preferences
from home interface.

  
Will do, sir.

  
All right, what do you say?

  
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

  
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

  
Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

  
Do a check on control surfaces.

  
As you wish.

  
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

  
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

  
Start listening in on ground control.

  
Sir, there are still terabytes

  
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

  
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

  
Ready? In three, two, one.

  
Handles like a dream.

  
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

  
What's SR-71's record?

  
The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.

  
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

  
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

  
Keep going!

  
Higher!

  
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

  
Come on, we got to break the ice!

  
Kill power.

  
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

  
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

  
A very astute observation, sir.

  
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

  
we should improve the exosystems.

  
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

  
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

  
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

  
- Got it?
- Yes.

  
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

  
Thrill me.

  
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

  
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

  
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

  
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

  
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

  
... hasn't been seen in public

  
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

  
Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

  
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

  
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

  
The render is complete.

  
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

  
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

  
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

  
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

  
The render is complete.

  
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

  
Commencing automated assembly.

  
Estimated completion time is five hours.

  
Don't wait up for me, honey.

  
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

  
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

  
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

  
You look great, Hef.

  
We're going to have a great quarter.

  
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

  
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

  
I'll see you inside.

  
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

  
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

  
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

  
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

  
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

  
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

  
God, you need a new name for that.

  
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

  
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

  
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

  
and time can be a factor
with these things.

  
Let's just put something on the books.

  
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

  
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

  
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

  
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

  
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

  
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

  
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

  
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

  
Yes.

  
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

  
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

  
Am I making you uncomfortable?

  
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

  
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

  
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

  
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

  
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

  
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

  
What's your Social Security number?

  
- Five.
- Five?

  
- Right.
- Right.

  
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

  
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

  
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

  
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

  
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

  
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

  
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

  
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

  
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

  
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

  
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

  
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

  
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

  
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

  
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

  
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

  
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

  
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

  
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

  
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

  
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

  
Make one of them dirty, will you?

  
Wow. Tony Stark.

  
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

  
- Carrie.
- Christine.

  
- Carrie.
- Christine.

  
That's right.

  
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

  
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

  
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

  
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

  
involvement in this latest atrocity.

  
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

  
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

  
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

  
Is this what you call accountability?

  
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

  
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

  
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

  
Well, I'm not my company.

  
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

  
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

  
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

  
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

  
"This is how we do business."

  
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

  
Tony, your picture, please!

  
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

  
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

  
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

  
It was the only way I could protect you.

  
No. No.

  
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

  
as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

  
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

  
have been driven from their homes,

  
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

  
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

  
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

  
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

  
Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

  
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

  
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

  
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

  
With no political will
or international pressure,

  
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

  
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

  
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

  
either forced to join their militia...

  
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

  
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

  
A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

  
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

  
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

  
He's all yours.

  
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

  
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

  
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

  
Get those monitors up!

  
We got a bogey!

  
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

  
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

  
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

  
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

  
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

  
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

  
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

  
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

  
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

  
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

  
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

  
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

  
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

  
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

  
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

  
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

  
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

  
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

  
- Hello?
- Tony?

  
- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

  
- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

  
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

  
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

  
It's funny how that works, huh?

  
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

  
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

  
Well, that's a hot spot.

  
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

  
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

  
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

  
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

  
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

  
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

  
- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

  
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

  
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

  
That's my exit.

  
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

  
Whiplash One, what is it?

  
I've got no idea.

  
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

  
Then you are clear to engage.

  
Hit it.

  
That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

  
- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

  
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

  
Deploy flaps!

  
Holy!

  
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

  
The sat visual has been lost.

  
No way that's a UAV.

  
What is it?

  
I can't see anything.

  
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

  
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

  
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

  
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

  
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

  
No, see, this isn't a game.

  
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

  
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

  
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

  
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

  
- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.

  
On your belly!

  
It looks like a man!

  
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

  
I'm hit! I'm hit!

  
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

  
Punch out! Punch out!

  
Whiplash One down.

  
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

  
Negative! No chute, no chute!

  
My chute's jammed!

  
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

  
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

  
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

  
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-
  
inside a legal no fly zone!

  
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

  
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

  
Keep going!

  
Good chute! Good chute!

  
- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

  
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

  
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

  
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

  
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

  
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

  
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

  
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

  
It's not that simple.

  
An unfortunate training exercise

  
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

  
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

  
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

  
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

  
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

  
Hey!

  
It is a tight fit, sir.

  
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

  
Be gentle. This is my first time.

  
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

  
- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

  
What's going on here?

  
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

  
Are those bullet holes?

  
Welcome.

  
Compliments of Tony Stark.

  
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

  
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

  
Show me the weapon.

  
Come. Leave your guards outside.

  
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

  
So this is how he did it.

  
This is only a first, crude effort.

  
Stark has perfected his design.

  
He has made a masterpiece of death.

  
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

  
And you dream of Stark's throne.

  
We have a common enemy.

  
If we are still in business,

  
I will give you these designs

  
as a gift.

  
And in turn,

  
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

  
Technology.

  
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

  
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.

  
That's the least of your problems.

  
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

  
All right, let's finish up here.

  
Set up Sector underneath the arc reactor,

  
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

  
I want a prototype right away.

  
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

  
I need you to go to my office.

  
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

  
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

  
This'll get you in.

  
It's probably under Executive Files.

  
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

  
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

  
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

  
Same drill.

  
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

  
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

  
Tony,

  
you know that
I would help you with anything,

  
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

  
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

  
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

  
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

  
Is that so?

  
Well, then, I quit.

  
You stood by my side all these years

  
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

  
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

  
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

  
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

  
I shouldn't be alive,

  
unless it was for a reason.

  
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

  
I just finally know what I have to do.

  
And I know in my heart that it's right.

  
You're all I have, too, you know.

  
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

  
You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

  
- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

  
... your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

  
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

  
So, what are we going to do about this?

  
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

  
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

  
I was so happy when he came home.

  
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

  
Now I realize,

  
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

  
He left a part of himself in that cave.

  
Breaks my heart.

  
Well, he's a complicated person.

  
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

  
You are a very rare woman.

  
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

  
Thank you. Thanks.

  
I'd better get back there.

  
Is that today's paper?

  
Yes.

  
Do you mind?

  
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

  
Of course.

  
Take care.

  
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

  
Nope, right now. Come with me.

  
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

  
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

  
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

  
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

  
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

  
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

  
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

  
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

  
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

  
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

  
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

  
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

  
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

  
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

  
Tony?

  
Tony, are you there? Hello?

  
Breathe.

  
Easy, easy.

  
You remember this one, right?

  
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

  
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

  
Tony.

  
When I ordered the hit on you,

  
I worried that I was

  
killing the golden goose.

  
But, you see, it was just

  
fate that you survived that.

  
You had one last golden egg to give.

  
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

  
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

  
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

  
Oh, it's beautiful.

  
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

  
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

  
This is your legacy.

  
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

  
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

  
put the balance of power in our hands.

  
The right hands.

  
I wish you could've seen my prototype.

  
It's not as...

  
Well, not as conservative as yours.

  
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

  
I would have preferred that she lived.

  
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

  
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

  
Okay, where's Tony now?

  
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

  
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

  
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

  
Good boy.

  
Tony?

  
Tony?

  
Tony?

  
Tony?

  
Tony!

  
Tony! You okay?

  
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

  
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

  
That's not going to be enough.

  
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

  
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

  
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

  
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

  
You might want to take
a few steps back.

  
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

  
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

  
You need me to do anything else?

  
Keep the skies clear.

  
Damn!

  
Next time, baby.

  
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

  
I thought it'd be bigger.

  
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

  
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

  
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

  
Keep me posted.

  
Pepper!

  
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

  
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

  
- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

  
Get out of there right now!

  
Where do you think you're going?

  
Your services are no longer required.

  
Stane!

  
I love this suit!

  
- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

  
Divert power to chest RT.

  
Power reduced to 19%.

  
Lady!

  
No, no, no, no, no, no!

  
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

  
I built this company from nothing!

  
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

  
Least of all you!

  
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

  
I've made some upgrades of my own!

  
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

  
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

  
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

  
I know the math! Do it!

  
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

  
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

  
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

  
Yes, sir.

  
- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

  
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

  
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

  
Stop telling me!

  
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

  
How'd you solve the icing problem?

  
Icing problem?

  
Might want to look into it.

  
Two percent.

  
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

  
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

  
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

  
Nice try!

  
- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

  
Flares!

  
Very clever, Tony.

  
- Potts?
- Tony!

  
This isn't working.

  
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

  
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

  
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

  
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

  
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

  
It's going to fry everything up here.

  
Okay. I'm going in now.

  
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

  
This looks important!

  
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

  
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

  
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

  
You'd have made your father proud!

  
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

  
Tony!

  
How ironic, Tony!

  
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

  
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

  
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

  
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

  
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

  
Push it!

  
Tony!

  
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

  
at Stark Industries last night.

  
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

  
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

  
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

  
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

  
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

  
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

  
Here's your alibi.

  
Okay.

  
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

  
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

  
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

  
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

  
alone on the island.

  
- That's what happened.
- All right.

  
Just read it, word for word.

  
There's nothing about Stane here.

  
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

  
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

  
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

  
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

  
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

  
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

  
You've got 90 seconds.

  
Agent Coulson?

  
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

  
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

  
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

  
Right.

  
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

  
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

  
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

  
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

  
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

  
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

  
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

  
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

  
crazy about me.

  
Tell me you never think about that night.

  
- What night?
- You know.

  
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

  
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

  
and you left me there, by myself?

  
Is that the night you're talking about?

  
Thought so.

  
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

  
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

  
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

  
Been a while since I was in front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

  
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

  
on the freeway and the rooftop...

  
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

  
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

  
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

  
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

  
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

  
I never said you were a superhero.

  
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

  
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

  
With this laundry list
of character defects,

  
all the mistakes I've made,

  
- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

  
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

  
The truth is

  
I am Iron Man.

  
Jarvis!

  
Welcome home, sir.

  
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

  
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

  
You just don't know it yet.

  
Who the hell are you?

  
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

  
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.

Man (V.O): 270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15000 feet. You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone
(ACDC’s Shoot to Thrill starts to play)
6 MONTHS LATER
(And a picture of Iron Man with an opening door in the bottom of an aeroplane. And he jumps out said aeroplane, landing on a stage. All very ostentatious. Dancing girls. Fireworks.)
STARK EXPO – FLUSHING, NEW YORK.
(Dismantling Iron Man suit.)
Pretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
Tony: It’s good to be back. You missed me?
Man in crowd: Blow something up!
Tony: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
Woman in crowd: I love you Tony!
Tony: Please, it’s not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. [Big cheer from crowd.] And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
Howard Stark (on a screen, courtesy of a video recording): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind, [Tony is off the stage, doing something. Blood toxicity test. Gives a reading of 19%. Not good] and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.

[Video ends. Cut to news feed of reporter outside.]
Reporter: We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.

Happy Hogan: Make sure you join me…

Tony: All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.

Happy: Open up, let’s go.

[Image is Tony trying to pass through the crowd, from Tony’s perspective.]

Tony: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.

People: Tony, Tony

Tony: Hey, hey.

Woman: Call me.

Happy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

Tony: [signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.

Happy: Okay

Tony: [what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy

Happy: This is Larry.

Tony: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.

Larry: Call me. Call me.

Happy: Larry King.

Tony: Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.

Happy: [Scene shows them finally at the door] Come on, Tony. There we go.

Tony: Very mellow.

Happy: That wasn’t so bad.

Tony: No, it was perfect.

Happy: Look what we got here, the new model.

Tony: Hey, does she come with the car?

Happy: I certainly hope so. Hi.

Tony: Hi. And you are?

Woman: Marshal.

Tony: Irish. I like it.

Marshal: Pleased to meet you Tony.

Tony: I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?

Marshal: Bedford.

Tony: What are you doing here?

Marshal: Looking for you.

Tony: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?

Marshal: Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn’t take it]

Tony: Yikes.

Happy: [Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn’t like to be handed things.

Tony: Yeah, I have a peeve.

Marshal: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.

Tony: Can I see a badge?

Marshal: You wanna see the badge?

Happy: He likes the badge.

Marshal: [showing him her badge.] You still like it?

Tony: Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?

Happy: D.C.? 250 miles.

[Drive off. Image slides over, like when you used to make Powerpoints with all the transitions. It now shows Washing D.C. You can tell because words appear saying…]

WASHINGTON D.C.

Senator Stern: Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.

Tony: [turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?

Senator Stern: Can I have your attention?

Tony: Absolutely.

Stern: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?

Tony: I do not.

Stern: You do not?

Tony: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.

Stern: The Iron Man weapon.

Tony: My device does not fit that description.

Stern: Well… How would you describe it?

Tony: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.

Stern: As?

Tony: It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.

Stern: It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.

Tony: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…

Stern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.

Tony: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.

Stern: Look, I’m no expert…

Tony: In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.

[People laugh. He waves. Pepper does not look impressed at all. He mouths “no?” and she shakes her head.]

Stern: I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.

Tony: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.

Justin Hammer: Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

Stern: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.

Tony: Rhodey? What?

[Rhodey walks in, Tony gets up to greet him] \

Tony: Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.

Rhodey: Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.

Tony: I just…

Rhodey: Drop it.

Tony: All right, I’ll drop it.

Stern: I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?

Rhodey: You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?

Stern: Yes, sir.

Rhodey: It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

Stern: I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…

Rhodey: You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…

Stern: Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

Rhodey: Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…

Stern: That’s enough Colonel

Rhodey: …to fold Mr Stark…

Stern: That’s enough

Rhodey: …into the existing chain of command, Senator.

Tony: I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.

[Laughs from crowd.]

Tony: We can amend the hours a little bit.

Stern: I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report.

Rhodey: I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.

Stern: With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images.

Rhodey: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…

[Tony is doing something on a Stark device]

Rhodey: … indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.

Tony: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.

Stern: What is he doing?

Tony: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn’t work very well at all.]

Stern: Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up]

Tony: Iran.

[This suit can fly. For all of five seconds before crashing, judging by the smoke, probably on fire. Justin is by the screen, trying to find the off switch.]

Tony: No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?

[Yep, it’s a video of Justin Hammer. With a suit. Again that really doesn’t work.]

Tony: Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up.

TV Justin: Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

[Language Justin]

Tony: [Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.

Justin: I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.

Stern: I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…

Tony: The point is, you’re welcome, I guess

Stern: For what?

Tony: Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.

[Stands up and turns around to face the crowd]

Tony: I’ve successfully privatised world peace.

[Both hands make peace signs and everyone stands up, all talking at once]

Tony: What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

Stern: [beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.

Tony: [puts on sunglasses. Rhodey’s still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they’re both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay.

Stern: You’ve been a delight.

[Kind of scene change. It’s now on a television on a Russian news channel with Russian dubbing. Because it’s a film where the selected language is English, we can still here the English clearer than the Russian. We’re back to Ivan.]

Tony (on TV): My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.

[Ivan is still working. There’s things going blue. It works. It’s not a full suit, but it does now look like he has whips made of lightning. Scene change. Tony’s house. He’s in his workshop. Pans in from across the ocean]

MALIBU, CALIFORNIA

Tony: Wake up, Daddy’s home.

Jarvis (V.O., A.I): Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.

[One of the robots is trying to make a smoothie. Without a blender lid]

Tony: You!

[You knocks over the blender. Well, he tried.]

Tony: I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.

[You looks down, sad.]

Tony: How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?

Jarvis: We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.

[Tony downs green liquid]

Tony: Check palladium levels.

[Using the same machine as before]

Jarvis: Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.

Tony: [Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they’re running out quick.

Jarvis: I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.

[Tony inputs a new core. It’s silver, giving a judgment of just how badly damaged the other one was. Replaces Arc Reactor in chest.]

Jarvis: You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you.

[Which we can see from the image of Tony’s chest on the computer screen. There’s blue lines all around the Arc Reactor. Camera angle shifts to focus on his actual chest.]

Jarvis: Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…

Tony: Mute.

[Shirt back down, computers switched to screen saver, Pepper inputs a code and opens the door]

Pepper: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?

Tony: What?

Pepper: What are you thinking?

Tony: Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.

Pepper: Did you just donate…

Tony: Keep your business.

[Both walking around the room]

Pepper: …our entire modern art collection to the…

Tony: Boy Scouts of America.

Pepper: …Boy Scouts of America?

Tony: Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.

Pepper: No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.

Tony: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

Pepper: You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.

Tony: [to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.

Pepper: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

Tony: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?

Pepper: That’s rude.

Tony: There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…

Pepper: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

Tony: [Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.

Pepper: You’ve got to be kidding.

Tony: I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.

Pepper: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?

Tony: No. Our stocks have never been higher.

Pepper: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.

Tony: You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.

Pepper: Let me give you an example.

Tony: Let’s move onto another subject.

Pepper: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.

Tony: I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.

[Tony is now stood on a desk about to take down the Barnett Newman to put the Iron Man picture up].

Tony: Let’s see what I can get going on here.

Pepper: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.

Tony: Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.

Pepper: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…

Tony: Everything was my idea.

Pepper: …and you won’t make a decision.

Tony: I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.

Pepper: I do what?

Tony: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.

Pepper: Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.

Tony: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.

Pepper: You will not give me the information…

Tony: I’m not asking you to try…

Pepper: …in order to…

Tony: I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.

Pepper: I am trying to do it.

Tony: Pepper, you’re not listening to me!

Pepper: No, you are not listening to me.

Tony: I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?

Pepper: Have you been drinking?

Tony: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn’t take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it.

Pepper: I don’t know what to think.

Tony: Don’t think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]

[We’re back in Russia. A man hands Ivan a letter down a twitten, out of sight. It contains a fake passport and a ticket. Another scene change. Tony and Happy are boxing. Pepper walks in.]

Pepper: The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?

Tony: I’m on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.

Happy: What the hell was that?

Tony: It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.

Happy: It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it

Tony: All right, put them up. Come on. [The Notary walks in. Both Happy and Tony’s attention shifts to her]

Pepper: I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.

Notary: I need you to initial each box.

Happy: [Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off… [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]

Tony: That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?

Notary: Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to the Notary as Natalie]

Tony: Front and centre. Come into the church.

Pepper: No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…

Tony: If it pleases the court, which it does.

Natalie: [To Pepper] It’s no problem.

Pepper: [To Natalie] I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.

[Natalie enters ring. Tony swigs down more green liquid out of a bottle]

Tony: Can you give her a lesson?

Happy: No problem.

Tony: [Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.

Pepper: What?

Tony: [Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?

Pepper: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.

Tony: I need a new assistant, boss.

Pepper: Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.

Tony: I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.

Pepper: No, it’s not.

Happy: You ever boxed before?

Natalie: I have, yes.

Happy: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie’s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]

Tony: How do I spell your name, Natalie?

Natalie: R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

Pepper: What, are you gonna google her now?

Tony: I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie’s file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual.

Pepper: You’re so predictable, you know that?

Tony: She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?

Pepper: No one speaks Latin.

Tony: No one speaks Latin

Pepper: It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.

Tony: Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.

Pepper: Well…

Tony: I need her. She’s got everything that I need. [Camera is now on Natalie and Happy, Natalie looking over, hearing what Tony is saying]

Happy: Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent. [He goes to take a swing, she grabs his hand and flips him over, legs over his head.]

Pepper: Oh, my God! Happy.

Tony: That’s what I’m talking about.

Happy: I just slipped.

Tony: You did?

Happy: [Who looks a little like he’s in pain] Yeah.

Tony: Looks like a TKO to me. [Rings the bell and Natalie leaves the ring]

Natalie: Just… I need your impression.

Tony: You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul.

Natalie: I meant your fingerprint.

Tony: Right.

Pepper: So, how are we doing?

Tony: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.

Natalie: Will that be all, Mr Stark?

Tony: No.

Pepper: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. [She leaves. Tony turns to Pepper]

Tony: I want one.

Pepper: No.

[News report is heard. In French. It’s about the Grand Prix.

Tony, Pepper and Happy are seen leaving a car and walking into a building. Happy is carrying a red suitcase]

Tony: You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.

Pepper: Go with it? Go with what?

Natalie: Mr Stark?

Tony: Hey.

Natalie: Hello. How was your flight?

Tony: It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you.

Natalie: We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don’t mind. Okay?

Pepper: When did this happen?

Tony: What? You made me do it.

Pepper: I made you do what?

Tony: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.

Pepper: You are so predictable.

Tony: That’s the amazing thing.

Natalie: Right this way.

Tony: You look fantastic.

Natalie: Why, thank you very much.

Tony: But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?

Natalie: You have a 9:30 dinner.

Tony: Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.

Natalie: Absolutely.

Tony: Is this us?

Natalie: It can be.

Tony: Great. Make it us.

Natalie: Okay.

Pepper: Mr Musk. How are you?

Mr Musk: Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.

Pepper: Thank you very much.

Tony: Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

Mr Musk: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet.

Tony: You do?

Mr Musk: Yeah.

Tony: Then we’ll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?

Pepper: Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage.

Tony: I’ll have Natalie make an…

Pepper: I don’t want Natalie to do…

Tony: Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you.

Pepper: Thank you very much.

Tony: Green is not your best colour. [Justin’s head appears from behind someone]

Pepper: Oh, please.

Justin: Anthony. Is that you?

Tony: [To Pepper] My least favourite person on Earth.

Justin: Hey, pal.

Tony: Justin Hammer.

Justin: How you doing? You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other? [She appears.]

Christine: Hi. Yes.

Pepper: Yes.

Tony: Yes, roughly.

Pepper: We do.

Justin: BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.

Christine: I know, I know.

Justin: Congratulations.

Christine: My editor will kill me if I don’t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

Pepper: Oh.

Christine: Can I?

Pepper: Sure.

Justin: She’s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I’d throw her a bone, you know. Right?

Pepper: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.

Tony: And she wrote a story as well.

Pepper: It was very impressive.

Tony: That was good.

Pepper: It was very well done.

Christine: Thank you.

Pepper: I’m gonna go wash.

Tony: Don’t leave me.

Justin: Hey, buddy. How you doing?

Tony: I’m all right.

Justin: Looking gorgeous.

Tony: Please, this is tough.

Christine: Can I ask you… Is this the first time…

Justin: [Posing for a camera while Tony replaces sunglasses and tries to escape] Fromage [French for cheese. That bit did have a subtitle] Say “Brie”.

Christine: …that you guys have seen each other?

Tony: God, that’s so awful.

Christine: Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?

Tony: Since he got his contract revoked…

Justin: Actually, it’s on hold.

Tony: …when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?

Christine: Yes, what is it?

Justin: No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.

Tony: Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot.

Natalie: Mr Stark?

Tony: Yes?

Natalie: Your corner table is ready.

Justin: I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

Tony: Hammer needs a slot, Christine.

Justin: We kid, yeah. We kid. We’re kidders.

[Tony is doing another test. It reads Blood toxicity 53%. He’s in a bathroom.]

Tony: [In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?

[And now he’s in a racing suit, jumping over the barrier towards a car.]

Justin: [Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I… Tony… I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We’re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do…

Tony (on TV behind Justin): Well, what’s the use of having…

Justin: …is a healthy…

Tony: …and owning a race car…

Justin: …competition.

Tony: …if you don’t drive it?

Justin: Is he driving?

[Camera shift to Pepper sitting at her table, probably waiting for Tony. She notices the television.]

Pepper: Natalie. Natalie!

Natalie: Yes, Ms Potts?

Pepper: What do you know about this?

Natalie: This is the first that I have known of it.

Pepper: This, this cannot happen.

Natalie: Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?

Pepper: Where’s Happy?

Natalie: He’s waiting outside.

Pepper: Okay, get him. I need Happy.

Natalie: Right away.

Justin: Tony’s… You know, he… We’re not competitive. You know what I mean?

Christine: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?

Justin: Just read me what you wrote.

Christine: I will. I will, after.

Justin: Just read it back to me.

Christine: But I have to make one quick phone call.

Justin: Where are you going?

Christine: This is great.

Justin: I’ve got some caviar coming.

Christine: This is great stuff. I’ll be right back.

Someone in background: Look! That’s Stark.

[And engines revving, set, go! The race takes off. A man dressed in orange as pit crew walks beside the track. He looks familiar. Tony’s surprisingly not bad at this race car driving. Orange man is on the track. Oh look, it’s Ivan. More French words. I got a “Mon Dieu” I think. The lightning whips strike a car. Pepper looks terrified. For Tony. Another “Mon Dieu” from the French commentator. Means “My God” by the way. Happy appears at the door and holds up the briefcase. Pepper goes with him to the car and gets in the back.]

Pepper: Go, go.

Happy: Hang on. [Crashes through a barrier onto the track heading the opposite way to the race cars. Tony’s car gets hit and he goes flying, loosing the front. Ivan heads forward. Another car gets hit. Bit of fire. Dripping petrol. Never a good sign.]

Pepper: Give me the case.

Happy: Here, take it.

Pepper: Where’s the key?

Happy: It’s in my pocket.

Pepper: Car!

[Ivan slices more of Tony’s car, but he’s gone. Tony comes up from behind him and whacks him around the head with a sheet of metal. Fighting. Tony is knocked on the floor. Sees dripping petrol. Ivan begins to swings the whips. Tony moves, hits petrol and the car bursts into flames. Happy appears, driving and runs Ivan into the fence. Tony is up the fence]

Tony: Are you okay?

Happy: Yeah.

Tony: Were you heading from me or him?

Happy: I was trying to scare him.

Tony: ‘Cause I can’t tell!

Pepper: Are you out of your mind?

Tony: Better security.

Pepper: Get in the car right now!

Tony: I was attacked. We need better security.

Happy: Get in the car.

Tony: You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing. [Ivan’s head moves. Tony opens the door] First vacation in two years. [And Ivan slices the door in half. Darn it Ivan, it’s a Rolls, be nicer to her]

Pepper: Oh my God! [Happy reverses a bit and runs into Ivan again.]

Happy: I got him!

Tony: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.

Happy: I got him.

Pepper: Take the case! Take it!

Tony: Give him the case!

Pepper: Stop banging the car! [Out comes the airbag and Ivan slices the car in half. He continues to slice at the car]

Tony: Calm down.

Pepper: God. God.

Tony: Give me the case! Please! Come on! [Pepper throws the case, Tony stand on it and it turns into the Iron Man Suit! A fight begins. Which involves more damage to the car and damage to the Iron Man suit. Tony rips out the Arc Reactor, shutting off Ivan’s suit.]

Ivan: [Being taken away by the police] You… You lose. You lose Stark. [Justin smiles.]

[Scene change. In a prison.]

Police officer [French]: On a vérifié ses empreintes et on n’a rien trouvé, même pas son nom. ([subtitled] We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.)

Tony [French]: Où allons-nous ? ([subtitled:] Where are we going?)

Police Officer [French]: Par là. En fait on ne sait même pas s'il parle. Il a pas dit un mot depuis qu’il est arrivé, pas un son. ([subtitled:] Over there. We’re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn’t said a word since he got here.)

Tony [French]: Cinq minutes ([subtitled:] Five minutes.)

Police officer [French]: [opening door] (Tony [French]: Non, non s’il vous plaît tout ira bien). Five minutes. {Door is shut behind Tony.]

Tony: Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.

Ivan: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.

Tony: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?

Ivan: My father. Anton Vanko.

Tony: Well, I never heard of him.

Ivan: My father is the reason you’re alive.

Tony: The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.

Ivan: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.

Tony: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap. [He gets up to leave]

Ivan: Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]

[Scene change. On Tony’s private aeroplane. Stern is on the television]

Stern: It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”

Tony: Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.

Pepper: What is that?

Tony: This is your in-flight meal.

Pepper: Did you just make that?

Tony: Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?

Pepper: Tony, what are you not telling me?

Tony: I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?

Pepper: Oh, yes.

Tony: It’s a great place to be healthy.

Pepper: I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.

Tony: Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…

Pepper: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.

Tony: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

Pepper: A leave?

Tony: A company retreat.

Pepper: A retreat? During a time like this?

Tony: Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.

Pepper: Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.

[Ivan is in a cell. A guard drops of food. Someone’s left a note about enjoying the potatoes. That would be easier if they were potatoes and not an explosive. A man enters, dressed like Ivan, down to the number. Ivan escapes. A guard notices that he is escaping and wants to stop him and says in French "Hé prisonnier! Arrêtes toi! Que fais-tu?" and Ivan breaks his neck. More French shouting. There was defiantly an “allez” in there. Ivan gets knocked out. He awakens somewhere else]

Justin: Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you.

Henchman [French]: Je te laisse pas avec lui. [no subs: I am not leaving him with you.]

Justin [French]: Laisse-nous. [no subs: Let us.]

Henchman[French]: Je te laisse pas il est ouf. [no subs: I am not leaving him, he is crazy.]

Justin: Oui, oui. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?

Jack: We have some salmon carpaccio.

Justin: Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy.

Ivan [Russian]: Если меня убьют, не буди меня. Лучше умереть, чем жить в своем мире. [no subs in the movie; If I'm killed, don't wake me. It is better to die than to live in your world.]

Justin: Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?

Ivan: Very good, man.

Justin: Very good, man.

Ivan: Very good, man.

Justin: Hey!

Ivan: [clinking bottle with Justin’s glass] Hey.

Justin: Yes?

Ivan: I want my bird.

Justin: A bird? You want a bird?

Ivan: I want my bird.

Justin: I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.

Ivan: I want my bird.

Justin: Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?

[Scene change. Pepper and Natalie are back in Malibu.]

Pepper: [on phone] Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.

Natalie: [also on phone. But a different phone] Yes, of course. [To Pepper] The AP wants a quote.

Pepper: [covers speaker] Don’t tell them. Fax them…

Rhodey: [entering] Where is he?

Natalie: He doesn’t want to be disturbed.

Pepper: He’s downstairs.

News reader (on television): But what happened in Monaco?

Pepper: Yes, but….

News reader: But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”

Pepper: Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.

[Scene change. Tony is sitting in a car in his workshop looking at holograms.]

JARVIS: Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters]

Rhodey: Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?

Tony: Let’s go. [Gets out the car. And falls.]

Rhodey: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?

Tony: Yeah, I should get to my desk. [Rhodey supports him] See that cigar box?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony: It’s palladium.

Rhodey: [Tony removes Arc Reactor] Is that supposed to be smoking?

Tony: If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.

Rhodey: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?

Tony: Road rash. Thank you. [Replaces Arc Reactor and starts drinking green liquid again.] What are you looking at?

Rhodey: I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.

Tony: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.

QUEENS, NEW YORK.

Justin: This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around. [Ivan puts on glasses and heads towards a computer] You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

Ivan [Russian]: Твой софт говно!

Justin: Sorry?

Ivan: Software shit.

Justin: Well… You’re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you’re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait! [Ivan pulls off one’s head] Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it.

Ivan: What you want them do?

Justin: Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?

Ivan: I can do that. No problem.

Justin: Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn’t I tell you? I had a feeling.

[Tony’s rash on his chest is getting worse. Natalie enters.]

Natalie: Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

Tony: I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.

Natalie: Probably.

Tony: Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…

Natalie: Ill-timed.

Tony: Right, sends the wrong message.

Natalie: Inappropriate. [Tony drinks a bit of his drink that Natalie hands him] Is that dirty enough for you?

Tony: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over. [Natalie hands him the box of watches] I’ll take that. Why don’t you… [She sits, smiles softly and starts helping him cover his bruise] I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?

Natalie: Legal.

Tony: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?

Natalie: I’d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with. [She leaves Tony finishes his drink. Scene change. He’s now drunk, by a DJ, dancing in the suit. Cars pull up outside]

Person: Good evening

Person: Good evening

Rhodey: Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I’ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch. [Enters party] Hey Pepper.

Pepper: I’m going to get some air.

Rhodey: What’s wrong?

Pepper: [Showing Rhodey Tony] I don’t know what to do.

Rhodey: You gotta be kidding me. [Tony falls over, drunk] That’s it, I’m making….

Pepper: No, no, no. Don’t call anyone.

Rhodey: Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

Pepper: I know. I know. I get it. I’m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it.

Rhodey: Handle it. Or I’m gonna have to.

Tony: [To crowd] You know, the question I get asked most often is, “Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?” Just like that. [Cheering. Pepper walks up to him]

Pepper: Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?

Tony: I love you.

Pepper: Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we’re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.

Tony: No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles.

Pepper: You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?

Tony: You’re out of control gorgeous.

Pepper: It’s time to go to bed. It’s time.

Tony: Give me another smooch

Pepper: You’re not going to be happy about this.

Tony: Come on, you know you want to.

Pepper: You just peed in the suit.

Tony: I know. It has a filtration system.

Pepper: It’s not sexy.

Tony: You could drink that water.

Pepper: Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…

Tony: If you say so.

Pepper: Okay. I’ll take this, you take that [exchanges microphone for bottle]

Tony: Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door. [accidently shoots it with the suit.] Yeah! [Girl throws bottle it the air] Hit! [Rhodey leaves as he shoots it] Pull! [Rhodey goes downstairs. Drunk girl is still throwing things for Tony to shoot. Rhodey gets into one of the suits. Another girl appears with a watermelon] I think she wants the Gallagher!

Rhodey: [In full suit] I’m only gonna say this once. Get out. [Helmet slips down. Everybody leaves.] You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!

Tony: [To DJ] Goldstein.

Goldstein: Yes, Mr Stark?

Tony: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to. [Laughs. Another One Bites the Dust by Queen starts to play.]

Rhodey: [Grabbing hold on Tony from behind] I told you to shut it down. [Tony takes off backwards]

Tony: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. [Rhodey throws things at him] Really? [Tony hits him with a set of weights] Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick.

Rhodey: [Hitting Tony with a pipe] Sidekick this. [Tony goes up throw the ceiling.] Had enough?

[Quick camera angle shift]

Pepper: Natalie!

Natalie: Miss Potts.

Pepper: Don’t you “Miss Potts” me! I’m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here… [Tony and Rhodey come crashing through the ceiling]

Happy: Pepper! [Runs in to get her out of the way] Get out of here. Get out of here now. [Natalie heads off somewhere.]

Tony: You want it? Take it! [Beats Rhodey and turns to growl at crowd, who run off. Rhodey gets back up]

Rhodey: Put you hand down.

Tony: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?

Rhodey: We don’t have to do this, Tony.

Tony: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.

Rhodey: Put it down!

Tony: You gonna take a shot?

Rhodey: Put it down!

Tony: No!

Rhodey: Drop it Tony!

Tony: Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony’s house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.]

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE

MOJAVE, CA

Rhodey: Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet… [Rhodey lands in suit.]

Major Allen: Colonel.

Rhodey: Major.

Major Allen: Wow.

Rhodey: Yeah. Let’s take it inside.

Major Allen: Clear the area.

[Scene change. Tony is sitting inside a doughnut, eating a doughnut. Pans out to see Nick Fury looking up at him.]

Nick Fury: Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.

Tony: [Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.

Fury: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?

Tony: It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…

Fury: I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.

Tony: Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?

Fury: That’s not looking so good.

Tony: I’ve been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can’t see her face.]

SHIELD agent: We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.

Tony: [Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You’re fired.

Natalie: That’s not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury]

Fury: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.

Tony: Hi.

Natalie/Agent Romanoff: I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

Tony: I suggest you apologise.

Fury: You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…

Tony: You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.

Fury: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?

Agent Romanoff: Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.

Tony: What do you want from me?

Fury: What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him.

Tony: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?

Fury: What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.

Tony: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.

Agent Romanoff: It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.

Fury: Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.

Tony: Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.

Fury: Well, I’m here to tell you, you haven’t tried them all.

[Scene change. Hammer Industries]

Justin: Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal.

Ivan: This is not my bird.

Justin: What do you mean? That’s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.

Jack: It’s a beautiful bird.

Justin: We got this bird all the way from Russia.

Ivan: Hey, man, this is not my bird.

Justin: Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?

Jack: No.

Justin: Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?

Ivan: Drone better.

Justin: What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?

Ivan: People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.

Justin: Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy.

Ivan: Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.

Justin: These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.

[Scene change. Air base]

General: Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?

Rhodey: Fully mission-capable.

General: Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.

Rhodey: Sir?

General: Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.

Rhodey: Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…

General: Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen.

Rhodey: Yes, General, but…

General: It’s also an order.

Rhodey: Yes sir.

General: Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud.

Rhodey: Thank you sir.

[Scene change. Tony’s house. It’s a bit broken. He is sitting with Nick Fury.]

Fury: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.

Tony: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…

Fury: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.

Tony: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?

Fury: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.

Tony: You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?

Fury: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.

Tony: He said that?

Fury: Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.

Tony: I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.

Fury: What do you remember about your dad?

Tony: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

Fury: That’s not true.

Tony: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.

Fury: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.

Tony: What?

Fury: I got a two o’clock

Tony: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?

Fury: Okay, you’re good, right?

Tony: No, I’m not good.

Fury: You got this? Right? Right?

Tony: Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.

Fury: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?

Tony: Yeah.

Fury: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]

Natalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha (We’ll stick with Natasha from now on): We’ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck. [She leaves]

Tony: [Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.

Agent Coulson: I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?

Tony: I think I got it, yeah.

Agent Coulson: Enjoy your evening’s entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.]

[Scene change. Air base. Dismantling the suit]

Major Allen: Think this is the power source?

Rhodey: Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?

Major Allen: Yes, sir.

Justin: [Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?

Rhodey: Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us.

Justin: What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…

Rhodey: That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.

Justin: Well, you’re talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you.

Rhodey: I think I’ll take it.

Justin: Which one?

Rhodey: All of it.

Justin: All of it.

[Scene change. Tony is looking through the box. Blue prints for the arc reactor. Newspaper articles. Video reels.]

Howard (on video): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath, [Tony is flicking through a notebook as the video plays] and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I’m Howard Stark, and everything you’ll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of… I’m Howard Stark and everything you’ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally… Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that? [Little Tony has picked one of the buildings up off the model.] Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where’s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go. [A man takes little Tony off, presumably to where his mother is]

Man (out of sight): All right, I think we got…

Howard: I’ll… I’ll… I’ll come in and… [Video changes]

Man: Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again]

Howard: So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he’s about to cry as the film ends.

Scene change. He’s driving down a road in car number plate Stark11

He stops to but some strawberries.]

Tony [Spanish]: How much?

Strawberry man: $6. Six.

Tony: I don’t have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch]

Strawberry man: No, sir, that’s too much.

Tony: No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine

Strawberry man: No, señor.

Tony: Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.

Strawberry man: Are you Iron Man?

Tony: Sometimes.

Strawberry man: [As Tony drives off] We believe in you!

[Now in Pepper’s office]

Pepper: It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.

PA: Miss Potts?

Tony: Relax.

PA: Mr Stark…

Tony: Is here.

PA: He refuses…

Tony: I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.

Pepper (on phone): Listen, it’s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.

News reporter (on telly): When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.

Pepper: No, the suit belongs to us.

News reporter: We trusted that he would look out for us.

Pepper: Yeah, but you’re not…

News reporter: He obviously did not.

Pepper: Burt…

News reporter: And now we learn that his secretary…

Pepper: Yes, it does.

News reporter: …a woman named Virginia “Pepper” Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?

Pepper: No.

News reporter: Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…

Tony: Mute.

Pepper: No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.

Tony: [Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I’ll get this stuff out of here.

Pepper: Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?

Tony: [Pulling up a chair] Will I?

Pepper: No, he will not. Bye.

Tony: I would like to be. Got a minute?

Pepper: No.

Tony: Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.

Pepper: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.

Tony: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.

Pepper: You didn’t come here to apologise?

Tony: Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…

Pepper: No.

Tony: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.

Pepper: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?

Tony: Yes.

Pepper: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?

Tony: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.

Pepper: I need you…

Tony: I need you too.

Pepper: …to leave now

Tony: That’s what I’m trying to…

Natasha: [Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?

Pepper: Hi, come on in.

Natasha: Wheels up in 25 minutes.

Pepper: Thank you.

Happy: Anything else, boss?

Tony: I’m good, Hap.

Pepper: No, I’ll be just another minute.

Tony: I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?

Pepper: No. That’s not so.

Tony: It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?

Pepper: Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.

Natasha: Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.

Tony: Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?

Natasha: [Latin]

Tony: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?

Natasha: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.]

Tony: You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.

Scene change. Driving it home, fading into workshop]

Tony: Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.

Jarvis: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.

Tony: [Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?

Jarvis: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?

Tony: That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.

Jarvis: What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?

Tony: I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]

Jarvis: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.

Tony: Thank Dad.

Jarvis: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.

Tony: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.

[Smashing walls with sledge hammers, drilling holes in the floor, fiddling with wires, putting together pipes.

Agent Coulson enters]

Agent Coulson: I heard you broke the perimeter.

Tony: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?

Agent Coulson: I was doing some stuff.

Tony: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?

Agent Coulson: [Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What’s this doing here?

Tony: That’s it. Bring that to me.

Agent Coulson: You know what this is?

Tony: [As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?

Agent Coulson: Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

Tony: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.

Agent Coulson: So I’m told.

Tony: Secret stuff?

Agent Coulson: Something like that. Good luck.

Tony: Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands]

Agent Coulson: We need you.

Tony: Yeah, more than you know.

Agent Coulson: Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.]

Jarvis: Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it’s concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]

Tony: That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers]

Jarvis: Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.

[Scene change. Ivan is also building an arc reactor]

Justin (on phone from golf course): Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we’d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.

Ivan: The drone is not going to be ready.

Justin: Not ready? What do you mean?

Ivan: I can make presentation, not demonstration.

Justin: What the hell is the difference?

Ivan: Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

Justin: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.

Ivan: I can make salute.

Justin: You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]

Ivan: Hey, man, everything will be okay.

Justin: This is not what I wanted.

[Justin is back at Hammer Industries. Enters Ivan’s room with two men.]

Justin: Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird.

Ivan: [As man grabs bird] Hey!

Justin: Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?

Ivan: [Russian] ты слишком много говоришь. [no subs in the movie;You talk too much.]

Justin: I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]

[Tony’s house]

Tony: Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…

Jarvis: Incoming call with a blocked number sir.

Tony: My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?

Ivan: Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.

Tony: You what?

Ivan: You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.

Tony: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.

Ivan: You too.

Tony: [mutes his speaker] Trace him.

Jarvis: Sir.

Ivan: Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.

Tony: Jarvis, where is he?

Jarvis: Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.

Ivan: What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.

Tony: Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.

Jarvis: Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

Ivan: I hope you’re ready. [Call ends]

Jarvis: Call trace incomplete.

[Sees advert for Justin’s presentation. Picks up new arc reactor]

Jarvis: Sir

Tony: You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.

Jarvis: We are unclear as to the effects.

Tony: I don’t want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!

[Stark Expo. Natasha opens the door for Pepper to exit the car]

Happy: I’ll keep the car down here, all right?

Pepper: Thank you Happy.

Announcer: …Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.

[Begins. Justin dances on to the stage]

Justin: Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad.

Pepper: Oh, Lord.

Justin: Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

Pepper: What? [Rises and salutes.]

Justin: For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for… [incoming Iron Man]

Tony: We got trouble.

Rhodey: Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.

Tony: Give them a wave.

Justin: Hey, all right. Yeah.

Tony: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.

Rhodey: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?

Tony: Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.

Rhodey: Vanko’s alive?

Justin: Yeah. [Tony approaches him]

Tony: What is he?

Justin: What?

Tony: Where’s Vanko?

Justin: Who?

Tony: Tell me.

Justin: What are you doing here man?

Rhodey: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Tony: [As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?

Rhodey: No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised.

Tony: [Takes off] Let’s take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off]

Rhodey: No, no!

Tony: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.

Jarvis: Yes sir.

Rhodey: Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock.

Tony: On what?

Rhodey: On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!

Justin: [Running to a computer] What’s going on? What’s happening?

Technician: The software’s been overridden.

Justin: What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?

Technician: I think he slaved the drones.

Justin: That’s impossible. Call the guards.

Jack: All the phones are down sir.

Justin: Well, then call their… Call their cells.

Jack: Their cell phones are not working either sir.

Technician: He’s locked us out of the mainframe.

Pepper: [Entering] Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?

Justin: Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled.

Pepper: Have you now?

Justin: Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?

Natasha: [Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?

Justin: Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

Natasha: Where is he?

Justin: At my facility.

[Natasha lets go and leaves. Pepper dials a number on her phone]

Pepper: I need NYPD, please.

Justin: No, no, no!

Pepper: Command Central.

Justin: No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities.

Pepper: Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.

[Tony is still being chased by Rhodey’s suit and the air force drones]

Tony: How are we doing Jarvis?

Jarvis: Remote reboot unsuccessful.

[Other drones are now firing at the running crowds. Natasha leaves the building.]

Security guard: This way.

Happy: Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?

Natasha: Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.

Happy: I’m not taking you anywhere.

Natasha: Fine. You want me to drive?

Happy: No, I’m driving. Get in the car.

[Lots of shooting drones and people screaming. The kid with the Iron Man helmet is targeted by a drone and holds his hand up. Tony lands behind him and shoots the drone with his hand repulsor]

Tony: Nice work kid. [Takes off again]

Rhodey: You got multiples coming in on you.

Tony: Let’s get this away from the Expo.

[Inside car]

Natasha: Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She’s getting undressed in the back of the car] I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.

Happy: I got it. I got it.

[Tony and Rhodey. Tony sets off one car alarm, the drones set off the rest.

Ivan is still typing inside Hammer Industries]

Rhodey: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.

Tony: Got it.

Rhodey: In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.

[Hammer Industries. Happy parks the car outside. More of less]

Natasha: Stay in the car.

Happy: I’m not staying in the car.

Natasha: I said, stay in the car.

Happy: [As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I’m not letting you go in there alone.

Natasha: You want to help? Keep the car running.

Happy: [Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.

[Ivan gets a security breach message]

Hammer security guard: Hey, hey, hey. You can’t come in here.

[Happy punches him and Natasha heads past.]

Second guard: Hold on. Hey!

[Natasha fights the other guards. Some using her SHIELD tech, some just kicking or punching them.

Back at Expo]

Technician: Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.

Pepper: Well, choose one and focus on that.

Justin: Have you tried Russian? Why don’t you try Russian?

[Hammer Industries. Happy is still fighting the same guard.]

Announcement: Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.

Security guard: We got it. We’re on our way.

[And Natasha throws something. And takes on like five guards at once. She walks away, casually spraying one with pepper spray. All this while Happy’s fighting one guy. Happy wins.]

Happy: I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done

Ivan gets up.

Tony is trying to let the drones away]

Tony: Rhodey, you still locked on?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.

Rhodey: Wait, wait, wait!

[Tony leads the drones through the globe sculpture. Most explode hitting parts of it.

Natasha kicks open Ivan’s door, a gun in each hand. Happy is behind her. The room is empty.]

Natasha: He’s gone.

[Tony and Rhodey]

Tony: I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?

[Directly above him. Both crash into biodome

Natasha puts her guns on the table and starts typing.]

Happy: What are you doing?

Natasha: I’m rebooting Rhodey’s suit.

[Rhodey is on top of Tony, who is pushing the gun to keep it from shooting him]

Rhodey: Tony.

[Natasha gains access.

Rhodey’s suit shuts down]

Natasha: Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.

Tony: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.

Natasha: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.

Tony: Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.

Pepper: [Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?

Tony: Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]

Pepper: What’s going on?

Tony: I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.

Pepper: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?

Tony: You didn’t let me.

Pepper: Why didn’t you tell me that?

Tony: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.

Natasha: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you.

Tony: Great. Pepper?

Pepper: Are you okay now?

Tony: I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…

Pepper: I am mad!

Tony: …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.

Pepper: Fine.

Tony: We could have been in Venice.

Pepper: Oh please.

[Tony taps Rhodey’s helmet as the system restarts.]

Tony: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.

Rhodey: [Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

Tony: [Helps him up] You okay?

Rhodey: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?

Tony: Don’t be.

Rhodey: No. I should have trusted you more.

Tony: I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

Rhodey: No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.

Tony: Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?

Rhodey: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.

Tony: Got you. Where do you want to be?

Rhodey: Where are you going?

Tony: What’re you talking about?

Rhodey: I meant me.

Tony: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.

Rhodey: Tony, don’t be jealous.

Tony: No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.

Rhodey: Yeah. It’s called being a badass.

Tony: Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.

Rhodey: Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.

Tony: Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?

Rhodey: It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]

Tony: See that?

Rhodey: Yeah, yeah. Nice.

Tony: Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.]

Rhodey: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.

Tony: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.

[Back inside Expo]

Justin: I told you that five minutes ago.

Pepper: [As police enter] That’s your guy here.

Justin: Excuse me?

Police officer: You’re being placed under arrest.

Justin: Are you kidding me?

Police officer: Hands behind your back sir.

Justin: I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me? [Being led away] I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon.

Pepper: [Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.

Police officer: We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.

Pepper: Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.

Police officer: Yeah. Are you coming with us?

Pepper: No, I’m gonna stay until to park is clear.

Police officer: Okay.

[Hammer Industries]

Natasha: Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.

Ivan: [Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.

Rhodey: This ain’t gonna be good. [Ivan’s whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.

Tony: With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony: I got this. [Targets points on Ivan’s armour. Doesn’t do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan’s whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?

Rhodey: What?

Tony: I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.

Rhodey: This is your idea?

Tony: Yep.

Rhodey: I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!

Tony: Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]

Ivan: You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones]

Rhodey: All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.

Tony: Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.]

Pepper: Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore.

Tony: You can’t?

Pepper: I can’t take this.

Tony: Look at me.

Pepper: My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.

Tony: I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.]

Pepper: I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.

Tony: What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.

Pepper: I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses.

Tony: You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.

Pepper: No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified.

Tony: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.

Pepper: Well…

Tony: You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?

Pepper: Thank you.

Tony: Yeah.

Pepper: Thank you for understanding.

Tony: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.

Pepper: I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.

Tony: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…

Pepper: Well, with you it’s like dog years.

Tony: I know.

Pepper: I mean, it’s like the Presidency. [They kiss]

Tony: Weird.

Pepper: No, it’s not weird.

Tony: It’s okay, right?

Pepper: Yeah.

Tony: Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again]

Rhodey: I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.

Pepper: I had just quit, actually.

Tony: Yeah, so we’re not…

Rhodey: You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.

Tony: You should get lost.

Rhodey: I was here first. Get a roof.

Tony: I thought you were out of one-liners.

Rhodey: That’s the last one.

Tony: You kicked ass back there, by the way.

Rhodey: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?

Tony: Not okay. Not okay with that.

Rhodey: It wasn’t a question. [Takes off]

Tony: How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?

[Scene change. Some kind of building. Tony is inside sitting at a table. SHIELD logo is there.

Picks up file. AVENGERS INITIATIVE PREMLIMIARY REPORT

Nick Fury enters while looking and stops him opening it]

Fury: I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]

Tony: “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.

Fury: Read on.

Tony: “Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony’s chair]

Fury: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake]

Tony: [Clasping his other hand on top of Fury’s] You can’t afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.

Fury: I’ll see what I can do.

[Scene change. Washington. ACDC’s Highway To Hell Starts to play]

Stern: It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.

Rhodey: Thank you sir.

Stern: Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo.

Tony Stark (V.O.): We create our own demons. Who said that? What does that even mean? Doesn't matter, I said it cause he said it. So now he was famous and that's basically get said by two well known guys. I don't, uh... (Sighs)

(Screen goes black.)

Tony Stark (V.O.): I'm gonna start again. Let's track this from the beginning.

(Effel 65's "I'm Blue" playing over the MARVEL logo.)

(1999, Bern, Switzerland, New Years Eve Party.)

Happy Hogan: (to Maya.) Half hour till the ball drops.

Tony Stark: Hey, do you want...?

Party Guest: Tony Stark? Great speech, man!

(Hogan moves the man away from Tony.)

Happy Hogan: I got you, pal.

Tony Stark: I gave a speech? How was it?

Happy Hogan: Edifying

Maya Hansen: Unintelligible.

Tony Stark: Really?

Maya Hansen: Mmm-hmm.

Tony Stark: It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.

(They start walking together.)

Maya Hansen: Where are we going?

Tony Stark: Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.

Maya Hansen: Okay, you can see my research, but that's...I'm not gonna show you my "town."

Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark

(As Tony & Maya are walking away the man intercepts them.) Ho Yinsen.

Tony Stark: Oh, I finally met a man called "Ho."

(Tony & Yinsen shake hands. While, Yinsen chuckles humorlessly; Tony turns to Maya.) Come here.

Ho Yinsen: I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu.

(Yinsen moves them towards Wu.)

Tony Stark: [to Wu] Oh, this guy.

Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark.

Tony Stark: Hey. (Dr. Wu greets Tony in mandarin as they shake hands.) You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I... (Tony turns, starts blowing on his party horn & walks away with Maya.)

Maya Hansen: Bye.

Ho Yinsen: Perhaps another time.

Tony Stark (V.O.): It started in Bern, Switzerland, 1999.

(People yelling indistinctly.) The old days.

Aldrich Killian: Mr. Stark!

Tony Stark (V.O.): I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they? [As Tony and Maya walk towards the elevator an enthusiastic man with long hair comes up towards them]

Aldrich Killian: Oh, wow! Hey, Tony! Aldrich Killian. (Stuttering to Maya) I'm a big fan of your work!

Maya Hansen: My work?

Tony Stark: Who isn't? He means me.

Aldrich Killian: Well, of course. But, Miss Hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of MIT.

[Tony, Maya and Hogan walk into the elevator]

Happy Hogan: Yeah, we're full.

[Hogan puts his arms out to stop Aldrich from coming inside, but he ducks under Hogan's arms and moves into the elevator]

Tony Stark: Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.

[Hogan traps Aldrich by the wall]

Happy Hogan: What floor are you going to, pal?

Aldrich Killian: Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately-funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics. [He holds out two business cards towards Tony and Maya]

Tony Stark: Uh... she'll take both.

Maya Hansen: Okay. [takes the cards]

Tony Stark: One to throw away and one to not call.

Aldrich Killian: Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short. (Points to the logo on his shirt) Do you get it?

Tony Stark: I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.

Aldrich Killian: Aw!

Tony Stark: (to the party of women in the elevator; referring to Hogan as they walk out) Ladies, follow the mullet.(To Maya) Ladies first.

Maya Hansen: (to Aldrich as she walks out of the elevator) Thank you, I'll call you.

[as everyone walks out of the elevator, Tony stops Aldrich from getting out by putting out his arm in front of him]

Tony Stark: I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.

Aldrich Killian: Yeah?

Tony Stark: Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. [steps out of the elevator] I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?

Aldrich Killian: I'll see you up there.

[the elevator door closes]

Tony Stark: Damn betcha.

[Scene change to Maya's room}

Tony Stark: Come on! I thought that was just a theory.

Maya Hansen: Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair...

[we see they are looking at a computer monitor with graph of the brain]

Tony Stark: Wow.

Maya Hansen: ...And chemically recode it.

Tony Stark: That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...

Both: ...Genetic operating system...

Tony Stark: ...of a...

Maya Hansen: Exactly.

Tony: ...living organism.

Maya Hansen: Yes.

Tony Stark: Wow.

[Hogan touches Maya's plant]

Maya Hansen: Is that... Can you...

Happy Hogan: What?

Maya Hansen: Can you not touch my plant? It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers...

Tony Stark: She's not like the others.​​​​​​ (to Maya) Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...

Maya Hansen: That's cute, but...

Tony Stark: Leave her ficus alone.

Maya Hansen: [turns to Hogan] Because... and, no, seriously don't. [walks into the bedroom]

Tony Stark: And you're starting with plants?

Maya Hansen: For now, yeah.

Tony Stark: Huh.

Maya Hansen: I'm calling it Extremis.

[Happy reaches for the plant and pulls off some leaves to just throw them on the ground.]

[Tony and Maya continue talking about her research in the bedroom]

Maya Hansen: Well, it's...

Both: Human application.

Maya Hansen: Exactly! Exactly.

[Zooms in on the plant and it's growing a new "Limb"]

Maya Hansen: Dendritic revitalization.

Tony Stark: It's revolutionary.

Maya Hansen: Disease prevention...

Tony Stark: Changes the world.

Maya Hansen: ...even limb regrowth.

[Goes back to Maya and Tony]

Tony Stark: You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.

Maya Hansen: Wow.

Tony Stark: In Switzerland.

Maya Hansen: Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.

Tony: This week.

[Maya takes off Tony's glasses, Tony laughs]

Tony Stark: You almost bought it, didn't you?

[Maya puts on the glasses and Happy shuts the door. He nods and they start kissing to be interrupted by an explosion and glass shattering.]

Maya Hansen: This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.

Tony Stark: Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?

Maya Hansen: The what?

[at that moment Hogan runs into the room and tackles Tony onto the bed to make sure he's okay]

Happy Hogan: Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss.

Tony Stark: We're good.

Happy Hogan: Stay down.

Tony Stark: You're...you're right on me. I made it. (Happy gets up) What the hell was that?

[People counting down outside.]

Happy Hogan: What was that?

Maya Hansen: It's a glitch in my work. It's...

Tony Stark: She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.

Happy Hogan: It's not Y2K.

Maya Hansen: No.

[Tony hears people celebrating outside]

Tony Stark: Hey!

Happy Hogan: Happy New Year.

Tony Stark: Happy New Year.

Maya Hansen: Happy New Year.

Tony Stark: Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight.

[Tony shakes hands with Hogan]

Happy Hogan: You good?

Tony Stark: Yep.

Happy Hogan: I'll be right outside.

Tony Stark: Okay.

[Hogan leaves the room; we then see Aldrich on top of the building waiting for Tony, who never shows]

Tony Stark: [voice over] So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.

[we see Tony writing a note 'You know who I am', and leaving it on the bedside table for Maya before leaving; Maya hears the door close]

Tony Stark: [voice over] Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.

[Present Day, Malibu, California - Tony is in his lab injecting himself with some devices]

Tony Stark: Ow!

JARVIS: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...

Tony Stark: No. Forty-eight. [he injects himself] Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.

JARVIS: As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.

Tony Stark: Which I will. Right, let's do this.

[to the robot that's using a broom to clear the rubbish off the floor]

Tony Stark: Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.

[Tony walks towards the robot]

Tony Stark: Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.

JARVIS: Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.

[addressing the Iron Man suits that are in their glass cages]

Tony Stark: Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.

[to Jarvis as he records Tony with a camera]

Tony Stark: Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence.

[Tony raises his hands and motions to activate the new suit]

Tony Stark: Jarvis, drop my needle.

[music starts playing, Tony moves with the music then points his arm where he'd been injecting himself toward the dismantled Iron Man suit on the table opposite, nothing happens]

Tony Stark: Crap.

[Tony bites his arm where he'd injected himself once and then hits it five times, he points his arm again and this time a part of the suit flies over to Tony and attaches itself to his hand and extends to his arm and shoulder, Tony then points his other arm toward the suit and the second part attaches itself to his hand and arm, Tony laughs]

Tony Stark: Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all.

[the leg part flies over and attaches itself to Tony's leg, then as another part flies over it crashes into one of the Iron Man suit glass cages, then another part hurls itself at Tony and Tony inflects it with his arm making it crash]

Tony Stark: Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a...

[suddenly another part of the suit shoots over and Tony ducks as it narrowly misses hitting him in the head]

Tony Stark: ...little bit.

[the other parts fly over and attach themselves with force to Tony's back and crotch area]

Tony Stark: Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

[then all the other parts shoot over and get attached to Tony, accept for the final face piece, which just hovers, facing Tony]

Tony Stark: Come on. I ain't scared of you.

[the face piece flies over and Tony flips over to grab the piece and finally the Iron Man suit is fully attached to Tony]

Tony Stark: I'm the best.

[at that moment, one of the stray pieces of the suit shoot over to Tony, knock hims down, which knocks the entire suit, except for the head piece, off Tony]

JARVIS: As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.

Tony Stark: [voice over] And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.

[the news on TV shows footage of The Mandarin]

Tony Stark: [voice over] That's when he happened.

The Mandarin: Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming.

[as this footage ends, the TV channels change and all the news channels are talking about The Mandarin]

[the news on TV shows President Ellis addresses The Mandarin Threat]

News Reporter #1: And now that we seem to be back, let's recap some of the frightening...

News Reporter #2: American Airwaves were highjacked...

News Reporter #3: The nation remains on high alert...

News Reporter #4: All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful...

President Ellis: Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot.

[we then see Bill Maher talking about this on his show]

Bill Maher: And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.

[then we see Joan Rivers on 'The Fashion Police' talking about the new Iron Man suit]

Joan Rivers: Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at rhat. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.

[Rhodes and Tony Stark are at a bar and they see Joan Rivers making fun of the Iron Patriot suit on TV]

Colonel James Rhodes: It tested well with focus groups, alright?

Tony Stark: [putting on a mocking voice] I am Iron Patriot...

Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.

Tony Stark: So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

[Tony moves closer to Rhodes]

Colonel James Rhodes: It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.

Tony Stark: Nine.

Colonel James Rhodes: The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.

Tony Stark: You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.

Colonel James Rhodes: When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?

Tony Stark: Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?

Colonel James Rhodes: People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.

Tony Stark: You're gonna come at me like that?

Colonel James Rhodes: No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic...

[a girl and a boy come up to their table]

Colonel James Rhodes: ...tator.

Erin: Do you mind signing my drawing?

Tony Stark: If Richard doesn't mind. [to Rhodes] You alright with this, Dick?

Colonel James Rhodes: Fine with me.

[Tony looks at the drawing of himself in his Iron Man suit that the girl has drawn]

Tony Stark: [To the girl] What's your name?

Erin: Erin.

[Tony looks at the boy standing next to him]

Tony Stark: I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.

[as Tony is signing Erin's drawing]

Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not...

Tony Stark: It's not superhero business, I get it.

Colonel James Rhodes: No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.

Tony Stark: That's why I said I...got it.

[suddenly as Tony is signing the drawing he looks ill, he places his hand on his face]

Colonel James Rhodes: Are you okay?

Tony Stark: I broke the crayon.

Erin: Are you okay, Mr. Stark?

Colonel James Rhodes: Take it easy. Tony...

Little Boy: [the little boy whispers to Tony] How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?

[suddenly Tony rises and starts walking off]

Colonel James Rhodes: Wait a minute! Tony!

[Rhodes follows Tony as he walks out the bar]

Tony Stark: What'd he say?!

Colonel James Rhodes: Tony!

Tony Stark: Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.

[Tony steps into his Iron Man suit that was parked outside the bar and collapses to his knees]

Tony Stark: Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?

JARVIS: No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.

Tony Stark: Okay, so I was poisoned?

Jarvis: My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.

Tony Stark: Me?

[Rhodes knocks on the Iron Suit's head, people have gathered around them watching Tony]

Colonel James Rhodes: Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up.

Tony Stark: Sorry, I gotta split.

[Tony flies off in his suit]

[at Stark Industries Hogan points to his badge as walks through the lobby passing the other employees]

Happy Hogan: Badge. Badge. Come on, badge. Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on. [referring to Tony's robots as Hogan meets with Pepper] Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use.

Pepper Potts: Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?

Happy Hogan: What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.

Pepper Potts: What!?

Happy Hogan: [to another employee as Hogan walks past them] Excuse me, Bambi.

Pepper Potts: [Hogan points to his badge] Did you just say that?

Happy Hogan: Security.

Pepper Potts: Happy?

Happy Hogan: Yes.

Pepper Potts: Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you.

Happy Hogan: Thank you.

Pepper Potts: However...

Happy Hogan: I do appreciate it

Pepper Potts: Since you've taken the post...

Happy Hogan: You don't have to thank me.

Pepper Potts: We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent

Happy Hogan: Thank you.

Pepper Potts: That's not a compliment.

Happy Hogan: That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.

Pepper Potts: I...

Pepper's Assistant: Excuse me.

Pepper Potts: Yes?

Pepper's Assistant: Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.

Pepper Potts: Thank you.

Happy Hogan: Did you clear this four o'clock with me?

Pepper Potts: Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.

[Pepper starts walking towards her office]

Happy Hogan: How so?

Pepper Potts: I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward.

[Hogan opens her office glass door and they enter]

Happy Hogan: I don't like the sound of that.

[as they step inside, they see Aldrich, looking handsome and fit in a business suit]

[Pepper looks shocked at the change in Aldrich's appearance]

Aldrich Killian: Pepper.

Pepper Potts: Killian?

Aldrich Killian: You look great. You look really great.

Pepper Potts: God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?

Aldrich Killian: Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich.

Happy Hogan: Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.

Pepper Potts: Happy, it's okay.

Happy Hogan: Yes?

Pepper Potts: We're good.

Happy Hogan: You sure?

Pepper Potts: Yes. Stand down.

Happy Hogan: Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here.

Pepper Potts: Thank you.

Happy Hogan: Okay.

[Hogan steps out of Pepper's office and closes the glass door]

Pepper Potts: It's very nice to see you, Killian.

[as Hogan waits outside Pepper's office, he sees Aldrich's man sitting in the waiting area]

Happy Hogan: Hey, guy.

[Hogan points to his security badge and the guy picks up his badge from the table next to him and holds it up to show Hogan he has a badge; to an employee as they walk past him]

Savin: Merry Christmas.

[Hogan looks at him with suspicion]

[back in Pepper's office]

Aldrich Killian: After years dodging the President's ban on "immoral biotech research", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down.

[he dims the lights then holds in his hand three small metal balls]

Aldrich Killian: Regard the human brain.

[he throws the balls onto the coffee table and as they roll and stop, they project a 3d image into the room]

Aldrich Killian: Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that...

[he presses his projector control which changes the 3d image to show inside of the brain]

Aldrich Killian: That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?

Pepper Potts Wow, that's amazing!

Aldrich Killian: Thanks, it's mine.

Pepper Potts: What?

Aldrich Killian: This...you're inside my head. It's a...

[he taps behind his ear, referring to something embedded inside his head]

Aldrich Killian: It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

[Aldrich rises from the couch and stands on the coffee table]

Aldrich Killian: Come on.

[he helps Pepper to stand on the coffee table next to him, they stand directly in the 3d image]

Aldrich Killian: Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.

[Pepper pinches him and immediately something lights up in the 3d image of Aldrich's brain]

Pepper Potts: What is that?

Aldrich Killian: It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.

[he turns Pepper round and presses his projector control and starts changing and moving the image with his hand]

Aldrich Killian: Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded.

Pepper Potts: Wow.

[as Hogan sits outside Pepper's office, he gets a call on his tablet, he answers the call and holds the tablet high so the camera monitor shows his forehead and eyes]

Happy Hogan: Hello?

Tony Stark: Is this forehead of Security?

Happy Hogan: What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.

[we see Tony is in his lab]

Tony Stark: What? Harassing interns?

Happy Hogan: Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face.

[Tony laughs]

Happy Hogan: I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.

Tony Stark: What's going on? Fill me in.

Happy Hogan: For real?

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Happy Hogan: Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.

Tony Stark: Right.

Happy Hogan: I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.

Tony Stark: Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.

Happy Hogan: Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?

Tony Stark: Um...Switzerland.

Happy Hogan: Right, right, exactly.

Tony Stark: Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.

Happy Hogan: Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.

Tony Stark: His what?

Happy Hogan: Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? [he holds his tablet up and points it towards Pepper's glass office, where Aldrich and Pepper are standing close together on the coffee table watching the 3d image of the brain, but all Tony sees is Hogan pointing the tablet camera at himself]

Tony Stark: Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.

Happy Hogan: I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.

Tony Stark: Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.

Happy Hogan: I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen! Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.

[as Hogan is talking, Tony uses his small tablet device to look up Aldrich and finds his photo]

Happy Hogan: Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.

Tony Stark: Relax.

Happy Hogan: Seriously?

Tony Stark: I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?

Happy Hogan: You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.

Tony Stark: A giant brain?

Happy Hogan: Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.

Tony Stark: I miss you, Happy.

Happy Hogan: Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...

Tony Stark: Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?

Happy Hogan: Why?

Tony Stark: I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.

[he puts his small tablet in his wine fridge and closes it and walks off still with Hogan online]

Happy Hogan: Yeah, nice.

[back in Pepper's office after Aldrich has show her his new research]

Aldrich Killian: Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.

Pepper Potts: It would be incredible.

Aldrich Killian: Mm.

Pepper Potts: Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...

Aldrich Killian: Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.

Pepper Potts: It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.

[we see Aldrich leaving the building]

Aldrich Killian: Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'

Pepper Potts: That's very deep.

Aldrich Killian: Mm

Pepper Potts: And I have no idea what it means.

Aldrich Killian: Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

[Pepper laughs]

Aldrich Killian: I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

[Aldrich kisses her gently on the cheek and Pepper watches him as he walks off, then Pepper notices Hogan coming toward her, Pepper looks flustered]

Pepper Potts: Happy...

Happy Hogan: The car is ready, if you're ready to go.

[Pepper glances over to Aldrich as he walks towards his car]

Pepper Potts: Yes. I just um... God, I forgot my... other thing, so... I'm just gonna...

[she walks back into the building, Hogan glance over to Aldrich's car and as it drives away, Hogan takes a photo of the license plate]

[later Pepper returns to Tony's home, as she gets out of the car she sees a large stuffed rabbit outside the house that Tony has bought for her as a gift, she walks inside]

Pepper Potts: I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!

[she notices Tony sat in his Iron Man suit on the couch]

Pepper Potts: You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?

[Tony looks at the small number marked 42 on the suit]

Tony Stark: Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.

Pepper Potts: Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?

[Tony rises and walks toward her]

Tony Stark: Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.

[Tony shakes his ass and Pepper laughs]

Tony Stark: Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?

Pepper Potts: Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?

Tony Stark: Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.

Pepper Potts: Okay.

Tony Stark: So, uh...tense? Good day?

[Tony walks up behind her and starts massaging her shoulders]

Tony Stark: Ooh shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?

Pepper Potts: Did I like it?

Tony Stark: Nailed it, right?

Pepper Potts: Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.

[Pepper turns to face Tony, she rises from her seat and stands close to him]

Pepper Potts: So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?

[Tony knocks the metal helmet on his head]

Tony Stark: Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...

Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.

Tony Stark: The facial slit?

Pepper Potts: Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?

Tony Stark: Crowbar. Yeah.

[Pepper starts walking towards Tony's lab]

Tony Stark: Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.

Pepper Potts: I'll take my chances.

Tony Stark: That's risky.

[Pepper walks down the stairs to Tony's lab]

Tony Stark: At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.

[Pepper sees Tony is in fact not in his Iron Man suit, but in the lab exercising as he remotely controls the suit, which follows Pepper into the lab]

Tony Stark: Busted.

Pepper Potts: This is a new level of lame.

Tony Stark: Sorry.

[Pepper notices the food tray in the corner]

Pepper Potts: You ate without me, already? On date night?

Tony Stark: [referring to Mark 42 suit] He was just...

Pepper Potts: You mean you?

Tony Stark: Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.

Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.

Tony Stark: And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.

[Mark 42 suit turns its face toward her, as if to look at her accusingly]

Pepper Potts: What?

Tony Stark: What?

Pepper Potts: Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?

Tony Stark: Happy was concerned.

Pepper Potts: No, you're spying on me.

Tony Stark: I wasn't...

Pepper Potts: I'm going to bed.

[Pepper turns and starts walking off]

Tony Stark: Hold on. Come on. Pep.

[as Pepper starts walking upstairs]

Tony Stark: Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.

[Pepper stops and looks at him]

Tony Stark: I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.

[Pepper walks back down]

Tony Stark: Nothing's been the same since New York.

Pepper Potts: Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.

Tony Stark: You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.

[he pauses for a moment and sits down]

Tony Stark: But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...

Pepper Potts: Machines.

Tony Stark: They're part of me.

Pepper Potts: A distraction.

Tony Stark: Maybe.

[Pepper walks towards Tony and they hold each other. He rests his head against her chest and she removes his headband that controls the Iron Man suits]

Pepper Potts: I'm gonna take a shower.

Tony Stark: Okay.

[Pepper turns to walk off, then stops and looks at him]

Pepper Potts: And you're gonna join me.

Tony Stark: Better.

[later that night, as Tony and Pepper are sleeping, Tony starts having nightmares about when he was in New York with The Avengers and had to get rid of the nuke in space, Pepper wakes and starts to shake Tony awake]

Pepper Potts: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...

[suddenly Pepper gets grabbed and shoved off Tony by Mark 42 suit, this wakes Tony who commands the suit]

Tony Stark: Power down!

[the suit shuts down and Tony hits it making its pieces fall apart, he looks over at Pepper who is in shock]

Tony Stark: I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?

[Pepper rises and starts to leave]

Tony Stark: Don't go, alright? Pepper?

Pepper Potts: I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.

[Pepper leaves the room]

[at the Chinese theater in Los Angeles, we see Aldrich's henchman meet a man who's sat outside the theater]

Savin: Can you regulate?

Taggert: Yes, I can regulate.

Savin: Are you sure about that?

Taggert: Yes.

[Hogan who's been following Savin, keeps an eye on him from a distance, he sees Savin giving the man a briefcase]

Savin: It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.

Taggert: Thank you...I mean for understanding.

[Savin walks off, Hogan walks towards Taggert and as Taggert rises to leave Hogan bumps into him which knock the briefcase out of Taggert's hand, falling open on to the ground]

Happy Hogan: I'm sorry, buddy.

[Hogan helps him put the stuff back in the suitcase, and as he looks at Taggert he notices that he is glowing red, Hogan starts to walk off taking one of the items from the suitcase, but suddenly Savin bumps into him]

Savin: What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?

Happy Hogan: Yeah, a little movie called "The Party's Over", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket. [Hogan shows him what he took from Taggert's suitcase]

Savin: No kidding? That doesn't belong to you. [Savin goes to take the item from Hogan's hand, but Hogan punches Savin in the face twice, Hogan notices Savin's face glow red and heal, then Savin grabs hold of Hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as Savin walks towards Hogan, Taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]

Taggert: Savin!

Savin: What?

Taggert: Help! Help me! [Taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds Hogan, as he lies injured, Hogan sees Savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened]

[we see another TV footage from The Mandarin]

The Mandarin: True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation.

[as Hogan lies in hospital critically injured, Tony is sat in his room when a nurse walks in to check on Hogan]

Tony Stark: Hi.

Happy's Nurse: Oh.

Tony Stark: [referring to the TV] Uh...mind leaving that on?

Happy's Nurse: Sure. [Tony rises from his seat]

Tony Stark: Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. [he pauses for a moment] One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. [Tony turns to leave]

[news reporters are all waiting for Tony outside the hospital]

Hospital News Reporter: We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [Tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us? [Tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car]

Pushy Tabloid Reporter: Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. [Tony turns to face the reporter]

Tony Stark: Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided [He removes his sunglasses and stares into the phone's camera] that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked. [to the reporter] That's what you wanted, right? [He takes the phone and throws it at a wall] Bill me. [Tony gets in his car and drives off]

[as Tony is working his lab]

JARVIS: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered]

Tony Stark: Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning "adviser to the King". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [Tony pushes the virtual information down to close] Close. [Tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]

JARVIS: The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.

Tony Stark: No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.

JARVIS: No, sir.

Tony Stark: Talk to me, Happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, Tony sees Hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] Any military victims?

JARVIS: Not according to public records, sir.

Tony Stark: Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.

JARVIS: The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.

Tony Stark: Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. [Tony looks at the information popping up] Nope. [he sees an attack in Rose Hill, Tennessee] That. You sure that's not one of his?

JARVIS: It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.

Tony Stark: Bring her around.

JARVIS: The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack]

Tony Stark: That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

JARVIS: Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]

Tony Stark: Are we still at "ding-dong"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?

JARVIS: There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]

Tony Stark: Right there's fine. [Tony dressed in his Iron Man suit walks toward her] You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?

Maya Hansen: You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?

Tony Stark: Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.

JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.

Tony Stark: That's right.

Maya Hansen: Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.

Tony Stark: Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] It's...with her.

Pepper Potts: Tony, is somebody there? [Tony steps out of his suit]

Tony Stark: Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. [Maya smiles] Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. [as Pepper starts walking downstairs, Tony moves towards Maya and speaks quietly] Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

Maya Hansen: He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.

Tony Stark: What...what for? Why now?

Maya Hansen: Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.

Tony Stark: I'll be fine.

Pepper Potts: I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.

Tony Stark: We weren't.

Maya Hansen: No, I...

Pepper Potts: And old girlfriends!

Tony Stark: She's not really.

Maya Hansen: No, not really. It...it was just one night.

Tony Stark: Yep.

Pepper Potts: That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.

Tony Stark: It was a great night.

Pepper Potts: Well, you know...

Maya Hansen: Yeah.

Pepper Potts: You have saved yourself a world of pain.

Maya Hansen: I'm sure.

Tony Stark: What?

Pepper Potts: Trust me. [to Tony] We're going out of town.

Tony Stark: Okay, we've been through this. Nope.

Pepper Potts: Yep!

Tony Stark: The man says no.

Pepper Potts: Immediately and indefinitely!

Tony Stark: Honey...

Maya Hansen: Great idea. Let's go.

Tony Stark: I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.

Pepper Potts: Tony, this is how normal people behave.

Tony Stark: I can't protect you out there. I challenged... [Maya notices giant stuffed rabbit Tony had bought for Pepper]

Maya Hansen: Is...is that normal?

Tony Stark: Yes, this is normal!

Pepper Potts: Sadly, that...is very normal.

Tony Stark: It's a big bunny, relax about it!

Pepper Potts: Calm down!

Tony Stark: I got this for you.

Pepper Potts: I'm aware of that.

Tony Stark: You still haven't even told me that you liked it!

Pepper Potts: I don't like it!

Tony Stark: I asked you three... You don't like it?! [as Tony and Pepper are bickering, Maya notices on the TV that helicopters are coming toward Tony's home]

Pepper Potts: Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.

Tony Stark: I said no.

Maya Hansen: Guys, can we um...

Tony Stark: What?

Maya Hansen: [she points to the bomb heading straight for the house] Do we need to worry about that? [The house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, Tony manages to get his Iron Man suit onto Pepper to protect her from the fall, Tony looks over to Maya, who's lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on Tony, Pepper saves him with the Iron Man suit]

Pepper Potts: I got you.

Tony Stark: I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] Move! I'm right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor between Pepper and Tony collapses] Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. [Pepper hesitates] Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! [Pepper manages to grab Maya and use the Iron Man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]

Pepper Potts: Oh my God. Tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around Tony]

JARVIS: Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him]

Tony Stark: Jarvis, where's my flight power?!

JARVIS: Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to fire a piano at a helicopter to destroy it]

Tony Stark: That's one.

JARVIS: Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]

Tony Stark: That's two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with Tony inside fall into the ocean, Pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean. In the water, Tony starts to feel like he's drowning]

Pepper Potts: Tony!

JARVIS: Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean.]

[The screen goes black]

JARVIS: Sir. Sir!

Tony Stark: Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.

JARVIS: That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]

Tony Stark: It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?

JARVIS: We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.

Tony Stark: Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...

JARVIS: I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.

Tony Stark: Who asked you? Open the suit.

JARVIS: I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

Tony Stark: Open eject. [the suit gets off Tony and he sits up] That's brisk! [as Tony starts to feel the cold weather.] Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.

JARVIS: I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]

Tony Stark: Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. [Tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to Pepper]

Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.

Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. [Tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] Let's get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] You happy now? [as Tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm, a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at Tony]

Harley Keener: Freeze! Don't move.

Tony Stark: You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] And now you're out of ammo.

Harley Keener: What's that thing on your chest?

Tony Stark: It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.

Harley Keener: What does it power? [Tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] Oh my God! [Harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards Tony] Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?

Tony Stark: Technically, I am.

Harley Keener: Technically, you're dead. [he give Tony a newspaper which has Tony's picture with the headline 'Mandarin Attack: Stark presumed dead']

Tony Stark: A valid point.

Harley Keener: [referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] What happened to him?

Tony Stark: Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.

Harley Keener: Like a mechanic?

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Harley Keener: Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.

Tony Stark: [Interupting Harley] It's Iron Patriot now.

Harley Keener: That's way cooler!

Tony Stark: No, it's not.

Harley Keener: Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...

Tony Stark: Retroreflective panels?

Harley Keener: To make him stealth mode.

Tony Stark: You want a stealth mode?

Harley Keener: Cool, right?

Tony Stark: That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.

Harley Keener: [as he touches the suit, Harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] Oops!

Tony Stark: Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.

Harley Keener: S...Sorry.

Tony Stark: Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?

Harley Keener: Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.

Tony Stark: Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.

Harley Keener: What's in it for me?

Tony Stark: Salvation. What's his name?

Harley Keener: Who?

Tony Stark: The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

Harley Keener: How'd you know that?

Tony Stark: I got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. [Harley reaches out to take it, but Tony pulls his hand away] Deal? Deal? What'd you say?

Harley Keener: Deal.

Tony Stark: Deal? [Tony gives the object to Harley] What's you're name?

Harley Keener: Harley. And you're...

Tony Stark: The mechanic. Tony [Tony looks at Harley for a moment] You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? [back at Tony's house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, Pepper stands alone and looks out across the ocean. She sees one of Tony's shattered Iron Man helmets and pulls it towards her, her forehead resting against the helmet's. She sees a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message Tony had left her earlier]

Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.

Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. [Pepper gasps and smiles] I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

[later that night as Pepper drives Maya home]

Pepper Potts: Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?

Maya Hansen: [A beat] I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.

Pepper Potts: Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...

Maya Hansen: That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.

Pepper Potts: This boss of yours, does he have a name?

Maya Hansen: Yeah, Aldrich Killian. [Pepper looks at her in shock]

[we see Aldrich talking on the phone to Savin]

Savin: Well, we took the house down, sir...

Aldrich Killian: Mmhmm.

Savin: But there's no sign of a body.

Aldrich Killian: I see.

Savin: No Stark.

Aldrich Killian: I have to go. [Aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done. [Aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of Mandarin's props in place and camera crew ready to record Mandarin's message] Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face.

[we then see the Mandarin arrive with his entourage and enter the house]

Mandarin Look-Out: The Master is travelling. [the Mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at Aldrich]

The Mandarin: Well then. What are we waiting for?

[in Rose Hills, Tennessee, Tony and Harley walk in town at night]

Tony Stark: The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see he's wearing a little girl's pink watch, Harley laughs]

Harley Keener: She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?

Tony Stark: Maybe never, relax about it.

Harley Keener: What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?

Tony Stark: I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and Tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that Tony came to investigate] What's the official story here? What happened?

Harley Keener: I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. [Tony looks around at the remains]

Tony Stark: Six people died, right?

Harley Keener: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Including Chad Davis?

Harley Keener: Yeah. [Tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site]

Tony Stark: Yeah. That doesn't make sense. [he sits next to Harley] Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.

Harley Keener: Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.

Tony Stark: Do you buy that?

Harley Keener: That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?

Tony Stark: No idea. I'm not...I don't care.

Harley Keener: That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?

Tony Stark: That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.

Harley Keener: Are they coming back? The aliens?

Tony Stark: Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?

Harley Keener: Does this subject make you...make you edgy?

Tony Stark: Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?

Harley Keener: Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?

Tony Stark: Nope.

Harley Keener: Do you need to be on it?

Tony Stark: Probably.

Harley Keener: Do you have PTSD?

Tony Stark: I don't think so.

Harley Keener: Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?

Tony Stark: Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! [Tony, looking agitated, suddenly rises] Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?

Harley Keener: What did I say? [Tony starts running off and Harley runs after him] Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. [Tony stops running and Harley catches up with him] What the hell was that? [Tony holds his face in his hands for a moment and then throws some snow at Harley]

Tony Stark: Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?

Harley Keener: Where she always is.

Tony Stark: See, now you're being helpful. [later we see Tony walking towards a bar and he bumps into a woman] Sorry. [the woman drops something] Lady, this uh... [he picks up the item and hands it back to the woman]

Brandt: Thank you. [Tony notices the woman has burn marks on one side of her face]

Tony Stark: Nice haircut, suits you.

Brandt: Nice watch.

Tony Stark: Yeah, limited edition.

Brandt: Oh, I don't doubt it. [there's a moment's pause] Well, have a good evening. [the woman turns and walks off] [Tony enters the bar and walks up to Mrs. Davis, who's sat at table drinking alone]

Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?

Mrs. Davis: Free country.

Tony Stark: It sure is. [Tony sits next to her, Mrs. Davis looks at Tony for a moment]

Mrs. Davis: Alright. Where'd you like to start?

Tony Stark: I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.

Mrs. Davis: Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. [she drops the file in front of him] Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. [Tony opens the file]

Tony Stark: Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?

Mrs. Davis: Yeah. [Tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of Taggart next to the photo of Chad]

Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.

Mrs. Davis: What?

Tony Stark: As a weapon.

Mrs. Davis: You're not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]

Brandt: Actually, I am. [Tony looks up and it's the woman he bumped into outsid the bar] [suddenly Brandt grabs hold of Tony's arm and twists it, slamming his head onto the table, Tony manages to quickly grab hold of Chad's dog tags that were on the table]

Rose Hills Sheriff: Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?

Brandt: It's called an arrest. [she pushes Tony to the ground and steps towards the Sheriff] Sheriff, is it?

Rose Hills Sheriff: Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

Brandt: Homeland Security. [she holds up her badge] We good here?

Rose Hills Sheriff: No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that.

Brandt: Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

Rose Hills Sheriff: Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me? [Tony gestures to Mrs. Davis to hide the file, she pushes it under the bar]

Brandt: Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good. [Tony notices her hand turning red hot, burning the badge in her hand]

Rose Hills Sheriff: Deputy, get this woman and... [suddenly Brandt shoves the hot badge into the Sheriff's face, she takes his gun and shoots him, Tony runs out of the bar and Brandt follows him, he turns to her]

Tony Stark: Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. [as Tony turns to run again he sees Savin getting out of a car and walk towards him, as Savin gets his gun out to shoot at him, Tony runs off and Harley throws something at Savin to make him miss Tony, Tony stops behind a car and sees a man hiding low on the ground] Crazy, huh?

Rose Hill Christmas Tree Shopper: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Watch this. [Tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as Tony and Brandt are fighting in the shop, Tony starts a fire in shop] You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. [Tony puts Chad's dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]

Brandt: That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

Tony Stark: Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [Tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, Brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing Brandt] [Tony stumbles out of the shop as people run past. A watertank falls down and traps Tony's leg. He finds that Savin has grabbed Harley]

Harley Keener: Let me go! [Savin mocks Harley]

Savin: Help me! Help me! [as Tony's leg is trapped under some rubble, Savin sits in front of him with Harley sat on his lap] Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?

Harley Keener: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!

Savin: Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, "I want my god damn file."

Tony Stark: It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies. [Harley uses the gadget Tony gave him earlier and runs away] Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. [Tony brings up his hand and reveals his Iron Man suit hand. He fires at Savin and sends him flying backwards. Tony makes his way out of the rubble before leaving.]

Harley Keener: You're welcome

Tony Stark: For what? Did I miss something?

Harley Keener: Me saving your life

Tony Stark: Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.

Harley Keener: Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.

Tony Stark: What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. [Tony gets in his car] I'm sorry, kid, you did good.

Harley Keener: So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?

Tony Stark: Yep [A beat] Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?

Harley Keener: [Childishly] I'm cold.

Tony Stark: [Mocking him] I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected. [Tony drives away]

Harley Keener: It was worth a shot.

[Savin wakes up, coughing and healed from Extremis. His face glows red.] [During an advert, the Mandarin takes over the satellite.]

Government Employee: Mr Vice President, I think you should see this.

Vice President: Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?

[On a plane, the President looks at a TV is shock.]

The Mandarin: Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards. [The screen zooms out to show a man lying on the floor while Mandarin points a gun at him] Good strong name. Good strong job. Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation. [Thomas sobs] But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds.

Thomas Richards: No!

The Mandarin: The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!

Government Official #1: How did he hack my phone?

Government Official #2: We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

President Ellis: I have to make this call.

Government Official #2: I'd strongly advise against that.

President Ellis: This is the right thing to do. [The phone rings but Mandarin doesn't answer. He waits for a few seconds before firing the gun.]

The Mandarin: There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon.

President Ellis: Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.

Military Aide: Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.

President Ellis: Right now.

Military Aide: Yes, sir.

(Tony Stark is reading over some files in a car. He sighs.)

Tony Stark: Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-

(Rhodey, suited in his Iron Patriot armor, kicks down a door & marches forwards.)

Rhodey: Don't move! (His phone rings.) Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?

Tony Stark: You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

Rhodey: Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?

Tony Stark: It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?

Rhodey: A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?

Tony Stark: Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony Stark: I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.

Rhodey: It's the same as it's always been, "WarMachine68."

Tony Stark: And password, please.

Rhodey: Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.

Tony Stark: It's not the '80s, nobody says "hack" any more. Give me your login. (Rhodey sighs.)

Rhodey: "WAR MACHINE ROX" with an "X," all caps.

Tony Stark: (He's laughing.) That is so much better than "lron Patriot."

EMCEE: Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?

Elk Ridge: Well, David...

Crew: Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...

EMCEE: One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.

Cameraman: Because you erase my shows!

Tony Stark: That ain't gonna cut it.

Cameraman: We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who... (Tony turns around.)

Tony Stark: Shh.

Cameraman: Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.

Tony Stark: Shh. Keep it down.

Cameraman: Tony Stark is in my van!

Tony Stark: No, he's not.

Cameraman: I knew you were still alive!

Tony Stark: Come on in. Close the door. (The cameraman gets in the van & closes the door.) Shh...

Cameraman: Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir...

Tony Stark: Yep.

Cameraman: I am your biggest fan.

Tony Stark: Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?

Cameraman: No, no, no. Just us.

Tony Stark: Great. What's your name?

Cameraman: Gary

Tony Stark: Gary?

Gary: Oh, wow.

Tony Stark: Right there is fine.

Gary: Okay.

Tony Stark: Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.

Gary: Oh, good. Can I just say?

Tony Stark: What do you want?

Gary: Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...

Tony Stark: It's fine.

Gary: It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.

Tony Stark: Right.

Gary: I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!

Tony Stark: A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?

Gary: Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...

Tony Stark: Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.

Gary: Got it.

Tony Stark: All right? It's a mission.

Gary: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Tony needs Gary.

Gary: And Gary needs Tony.

Tony Stark: Be quiet about it. Go.

Gary: Yeah.

(Tony types on the keyboard & accesses the files he needs. A video starts playing.)

Aldrich Killian: What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?

Chad Davis: Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me. (Tony types again and another video shows up.)

Aldrich Killian: Will you please state your name for the camera?

Brandt: Ellen Brandt.

Aldrich Killian: Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. (More typing, another video.) Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. (Brandt's missing arm grows back as she glows red. The other volunteers glow red & scream too.) We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here! (One of the volunteers exploads.)

Tony Stark: (He's muttering.) A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal.

(Pepper and Maya are in a bedroom talking.)

Maya Hansen: What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? "The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet." See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore.

Pepper Potts: You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.

Maya Hansen: Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.

Pepper Potts: That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself.

Maya Hansen: Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that. (Someone knocks on the door & Pepper looks over. She gets up & opens the door. Room service pushes in a tray of food but Killain appears & snaps his neck. Pepper gasps.)

Pepper Potts: Maya, run! [Killian grabs Pepper by the arm, spins her around and slams her against the wall, holding her by the neck.

Aldrich Killian: Hi, Pepper. (To Maya) So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?

Maya Hansen: I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.

Aldrich Killian: Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?

Maya Hansen: I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

Aldrich Killian: Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

Maya Hansen: Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.

[Rhodey flies across the sky in his Iron Patriot armor.]

Man: [On radio] This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

Rhodey: Copy. [Repulsor firing, people shrieking] Nobody move. [Women exclaiming in fear] Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure. [One of the women shakes Rhodey's hand and her hand glows red. Rhodey falls backwards, grunting.]

Woman: Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.

Rhodey: If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.

Woman: That's the plan, Colonel.

Tony Stark: Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.

Harley Keener: Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?

Tony Stark: How much have you had?

Harley Keener: Two or three bowls.

Tony Stark: Can you still see straight?

Harley Keener: Sort of.

Tony Stark: That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?

JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

Tony Stark: What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?

JARVIS: Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

Tony Stark: Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.

Harley Keener: Um, it does say Miami, Florida.

Tony Stark: Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?

Harley Keener: Uh, it's not charging. [Tony pulls over to the side of the road, heavy breathing]

JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.

Tony Stark: What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... [Breathing heavily] Oh, God, not again.

Harley Keener: Tony? [Tony gets out of the car] Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.

Tony Stark: Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.

Harley Keener: Okay, um, uh...

Tony Stark: [Panting] God, what am I gonna do?

Harley Keener: Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?

Tony Stark: Right.

Harley Keener: You said so.

Tony Stark: Yes, I did.

Harley Keener: Why don't you just build something?

Tony Stark: Okay. Thanks, kid. [He gets back in the car.] [Cut to Tony in a shop buying supplies.] [Cut to Tony building something.] [Cut to Miama, Florida. Tony climbs a wall and begins fighting guards. He makes his way into the house and finds a woman lying on a table.] [Cut to a different woman lying on a sofa with a man sitting at a desk.]

Woman: Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.

Man: [Scoffs] My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con... [Tony puts a gloved hand on his head, electrocuting him. He gets the gun and leaves the room. He makes his way to the bedroom and pulls the duvet off the bed, revealling two girls. Tony sushes them and the toilet flushes.]

The Mandarin: Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes. [He laughs] Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

Vanessa: That's me.

The Mandarin: Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?

Vanessa: There's some guy over here.

The Mandarin: They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.

Tony Stark: Hey! [Mandarin raises his hands]

The Mandarin: Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

Tony Stark: Don't move.

The Mandarin: I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

Tony Stark: What?

The Mandarin: Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

Tony Stark: Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?

The Mandarin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.

Tony Stark: What do you mean?

The Mandarin: It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.

Tony Stark: It is?

The Mandarin: It's complicated.

Tony Stark: Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit. [Door closes. Gunshot. Women exclaim in fear]

The Mandarin: My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

Tony Stark: What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?

Trevor Slattery: What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not. [Tony points the gun at Trevor's face] Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

Tony Stark: You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.

Trevor Slattery: It's just a role. "The Mandarin," see, it's not real.

Tony Stark: Then how did you get here, Trevor?

Trevor Slattery: Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.

Tony Stark: Next?

Trevor Slattery: Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.

Tony Stark: What did they say? They'd get you off them?

Trevor Slattery: They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things. [Snoring]

Tony Stark: Did you just nod off? Hey. [Tony kicks him]

Trevor Slattery: No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions. [Mimic explosion]

Tony Stark: "He"? Killian?

Trevor Slattery: Killian.

Tony Stark: He created you?

Trevor Slattery: He created me.

Tony Stark: Custom-made terror threat.

Trevor Slattery: Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.

Tony Stark: Your performance? Where people died?

Trevor Slattery: No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under... [Savin hits Tony around the head, unconcious]

Savin: Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

Trevor Slattery: I didn't tell him anything.

Savin: Nothing?

Trevor Slattery: No.

Savin: You should have pressed the panic button.

Trevor Slattery: Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

Tony Stark: Ah... [Sighs] Okay.

Maya Hansen: It's just like old times, huh?

Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.

Maya Hansen: It wasn't my idea.

Tony Stark: Okay. So you took Killian's card.

Maya Hansen: I took his money.

Tony Stark: And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.

Maya Hansen: No.

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Maya Hansen: No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.

Tony Stark: Yeah?

Maya Hansen: [Sighs and walks towards him] A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.

Tony Stark: [Shouting] I'm telling you it isn't. [Lowers voice to usual volume] I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

Maya Hansen: Then help me fix it. [She shows him the "You Know Who I Am" note he left in 1999.]

Tony Stark: Did I do that?

Maya Hansen: Yes.

Tony Stark: I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?

Maya Hansen: You don't remember?

Tony Stark: I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.

Aldrich Killian: You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... "The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."

Tony Stark: You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?

Aldrich Killian: How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.

Tony Stark: Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.

Aldrich Killian: But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.

Tony Stark: You're something else.

Aldrich Killian: You have met him, I assume?

Tony Stark: Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

Aldrich Killian: I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.

Tony Stark: What's next for you in your world?

Aldrich Killian: Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me. [Killian rolls three balls forwards and they stop, projecting an image of Pepper. She has Extremis.] Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?

Maya Hansen: Let him go.

Aldrich Killian: Hold on, hold on. Maya...

Maya Hansen: I said, let him go.

Aldrich Killian: What are you doing?

Maya Hansen: 1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

Aldrich Killian: It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector.

Maya Hansen: If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?

Aldrich Killian: We're not doing this, okay?

Maya Hansen: What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot? [He looks back at Tony and shoots Maya]

Aldrich Killian: The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.

Tony Stark: You are a maniac.

Aldrich Killian: No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight. [Killian leaves and talks to Savin] Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

Savin: Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it. [Whirring]

Aldrich Killian: Afternoon, gentlemen. [Whirring ceases] Hello, Colonel. Step aside. [Killian places his hand on the suit and it blows orange.] Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry.

Savin: You'll damage the armour.

Aldrich Killian: Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me.

Savin: She's still in Phase Two.

Aldrich Killian: You're not going deaf, are you?

Tony Stark: [Watch beeping.] Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?

Guard #1: 832 miles.

Tony Stark: Very nice.

Guard #1: I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?

Tony Stark: Break it, you bought it.

Guard #2: I think I bought it.

Tony Stark: Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.

Guard #2: What are you gonna do to me?

Tony Stark: You'll see.

Guard #2: You're zip-tied to a bed. This. [Nothing happens.] That. [Nothing happens again]

Alrich Killian: Are you coming out?

Rhodey: [Panting and sweating] Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open. [Beeping.] All right. Let's go. [The suit opens, Rhodey jumps and punches Savin in the face, then kicks him. Killian glows red and breathes fire at Rhodey.] You... You breathe fire? Okay. [Savin knocks Rhodey unconcious.]

Aldrich Killian: It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.

Tony Stark: Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...

Guard #2: How did we get this shift?

Tony Stark: All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!

Guard #2: Wow. That was...

Tony Stark: You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.

Guard #2: I am just beyond terrified.

Tony Stark: Here it comes. Three, four...

Guard #2: Shut up.

Tony Stark: [Quickly] Five, four, three, two, one! [The Iron Man suit joins to his left arm] Told you. Where's the rest? [He blasts one of the men and unties himself. As they fight, the suit connects to his rigth leg and he kicks them] Where's the rest? [Meanwhile, Harley watches as the garage door shakes. He runs over and blows it open. The suit flies out.] [Repulsor powering up, gunfire, screaming.]

Man: Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird. [Tony leaves.]

Tony Stark: Ah! Better late than never. [He gets outside and catches the face mask.] Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.

JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.

Guard: [Beeping, Rhodey wakes up.] All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.

Tony Stark: Ah! Let's go! [Thrusters misfiring.] Aw, crap.

Rhodey: Tony?

Tony Stark: Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.

Rhodey: No. You got yours'?

Tony Stark: Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

Rhodey: You, you, you! Move! Get out!

Tony Stark: [Girls whimpering] The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.

Rhodey: What's this? I had winners. [Gunshots. Trevor wakes up and begins drinking beer again.]

Tony Stark: What have you come as?

Rhodey: You make a move, and I break your face.

Tony Stark:I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.

Rhodey: This is the Mandarin?

Tony Stark:Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.

Trevor Slattery: Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.

Tony Stark:Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

Rhodey: You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.

Trevor Slattery: Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.

Tony Stark: Spill.

Rhodey: Do you know what they did to my suit?

Tony Stark: What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.

Trevor Slattery: Woah! [Rhodey jumps.] Ole', ole', ole', ole'...

Rhodey: Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.

Tony Stark: Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?

Rhodey: Yeah, a little bit.

Tony Stark: So?

Rhodey: What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.

Tony Stark: Right. [Beer opens] Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

Rhodey: But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?

Tony Stark: Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.

Vice President: Thanks. Hello?

Tony Stark: Sir, this is Tony Stark.

Vice President: Welcome back to the land of the living.

Tony Stark: We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.

Vice President: Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here.

Rhodey: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.

Vice President: Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.

Rhodey: Rhodes and Stark out.

Man: Everything okay, sir?

Vice President: Couldn't be better. (To his daughter) I love you, babe.

[The Iron Patriot lands and walks towards President Ellis]

President Ellis: Colonel Rhodes. [Salutes] Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.

Rhodey: We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.

JARVIS: Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.

Tony Stark: And what about the suit I'm wearing?

JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.

Tony Stark: That's going to have to do.

[The Iron Patient's arm opens and the suit wearer puts their hand against the door handle on a plane, burning it.]

Military Aide: Everything all right, Colonel? [Iron Patriot kills the aide and people begin shooting at him. He kills everyone beside the President. The helmet lifts up to reveal Savin.

Savin: It is an honour, Mr President.

President Ellis: If you're gonna do it, do it!

Savin: Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how the Mandarin works.

Officer: Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes.

Officer #2: Get me eyes on it now.

Officer: Image coming through now, sir.

Officer #2: Was that Rhodes?

Man: Is anyone there?

Woman: Let us out! [Tony attacks Savin and pins him against the wall.]

Tony Stark: The President. Now.

Savin: He's not here. [Savin burns the Iron Man suit's arm. Electrical crackling, mechanisms grinding, soft groaning.] Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish. [A door blasts open on the plane, people screaming, metal creaking, more screaming. Tony blasts Savin in the chest.]

Tony Stark: Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. [Savin falls to the ground.] How many in the air?

JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.

Tony Stark: How many can I carry?

JARVIS: Four, sir.

Tony Stark: Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?

Heather: [Screaming] Oh, God! No! No!

Tony Stark: Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?

Heather: What? Oh!

Tony Stark: I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.

JARVIS: 18,000 feet.

Tony Stark: Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.

JARVIS: 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.

Tony Stark: Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!

JARVIS: 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.

Tony Stark: He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. [Tony drops them all in the water from a few feet above.]

Man: We made it!

Tony Stark: Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper... [The Iron Man suit flies into a truck and the suit disassembles. He sighs.] That came out of nowhere. Wow [We now see Tony on the boat, where he was controlling the suit.]

Rhodey: Give me some good news, man.

Tony Stark: I think they all made it.

Rhodey: Oh, thank God.

Tony Stark: Yeah, but I missed the president.

Rhodey: You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?

Tony Stark: Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

JARVIS: The House Party Protocol, sir?

Tony Stark: Correct.

Aldrich Killian: [Pepper wakes up and gasps.] Hi.

Pepper Potts: [Breathing heavily.] You think he's gonna help you? He won't.

Aldrich Killian: Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um...

Pepper Potts: Trophy

Aldrich Killian: [Chuckles.] Mmm. [Iron Patriot walks in and Pepper gasps.] Good evening, sir. [The armor opens and the President falls out.] Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.

President Ellis: This is the Roxxon Norco.

Aldrich Killian:And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.

President Ellis: What do you want from me?

Aldrich Killian: Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up.

President Ellis: Hey!

Rhodey: [Climbs on to the boat.] Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?

Tony Stark: I hope not.

Rhodey: Oh, my God. [Sighs] He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.

Tony Stark: Viking funeral. Public execution.

Rhodey: Yeah, death by oil.

Announcer: (On PA) Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.

Aldrich Killian: Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal. (Technician typing)

Rhodey: ls your gun up?

Tony Stark: Yep. What do I do?

Rhodey: Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.

Tony Stark: Six, high, back. Alright. [Gunfire, bullets ricocheting] You see that? Nailed it.

Rhodey: Yeah, you really killed the glass.

Tony Stark: You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance. [Rhodey fires a bullet and hits the bulb.]

Announcer: [On PA] All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12.

Man: Over there!

Announcer: [On PA] I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.

Tony Stark: I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?

Rhodey: They're not universal, Tony.

Tony Stark: I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.

Rhodey: Okay

Tony Stark: Give me one of yours.

Rhodey: I don't have one that fits that gun.

Tony Stark: You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?

Rhodey: What'd you see?

Tony Stark: Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. [Clears throat] Three guys, one girl, all armed.

Rhodey: God, I would kill for some armour right now.

Tony Stark: You're right. We need backup.

Rhodey: Yeah, a bunch.

Tony Stark: You know what? [He nods at something in the distance, whooshing]

Rhodey: Is that...?

Tony Stark: Yep.

Rhodey: Are those...?

Tony Stark: Yeah. [Dozens of Iron Man suits fly over.] Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.

JARVIS: [Through armors] Yes, sir.

Tony Stark: What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.

JARVIS: Gentlemen. [Grunting, screaming.]

Tony Stark: Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing. [Mechanisms whirring.]

Rhodey: This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?

Tony Stark: Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? [Tony suits up.] Nice timing.

Rhodey: Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?

Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

Rhodey: What does that mean?

Tony Stark: I got you covered.

JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?

Rhodey: Very funny.

JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.

Tony Stark: About time.

Pepper Potts: [Gasps, panting.] Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

Tony Stark: See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?

Pepper Potts: You're such a jerk.

Tony Stark: Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner. [Metal creaking, Pepper sobbing.] Come on. A little more, baby. [Pepper straining, Tony grunting. Killian shoves his hand on Tony's suit, burning it.]

Aldrich Killian: Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there? [Sizzling.] Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.

Pepper Potts: Tony.

Aldrich Killian: She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this. [Tony cuts off Killian's arm, it burns through the floor and Pepper falls down.]

Tony Stark: Yeah, you take a minute. [Groaning, sizzling, metal creaking, yelling, grunts, Pepper whimpers.] Jarvis, give me a suit right now! [The suit he called gets destroyed.] Oh, come on!

Rhodey: Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on. [Gunfire] Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.

Tony Stark: Nice work.

Rhodey: Ready, sir?

President Ellis: What do you mean "ready"? [Rhodey blasts off and the President screams.]

Tony Stark: Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! [Pepper falls to the ground and into the flames below.]

Aldrich Killian: A shame. I would've caught her. [Tony and Killian run towards each other. Killian jumps up to attack, Tony slides under and armors up. Repulsors firing, flesh burning, both grunting.]

Tony Stark: Eject. [More repulsors firing.]

Aldrich Killian: Well, here we are on the roof. [Killian slices the suit in half.]

JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.

Tony Stark: I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns. [The suit flies to Tony, hits a piece of metal and falls apart. Rolls his eyes.] Whatever.

Aldrich Killian: You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.

Tony Stark: Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. [Tony motions to the suit and it flies on to Killian.] Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

Aldrich Killian: [Muffled screaming.] No! [He walks towards Tony, his flesh held together by flames.] No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. I am the Mandarin! [Someone hits Killian and he flies to the side. It's Pepper. Heavy breathing.]

Tony Stark: I got nothing. [Repulsor powering up.] Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me? [Pepper runs towards Tony, flips in the air, punches through the Iron Man suit and destroys it. She uses the suit to blow up Killian.] Honey?

Pepper Potts: Oh, my God. That was really violent.

Tony Stark: You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...

Pepper Potts: I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?

Tony Stark: It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.

Pepper Potts: You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?

Tony Stark: Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.

Pepper Potts: No, don't touch me.

Tony Stark: Don't worry about it.

Pepper Potts: No, I'm gonna burn you.

Tony Stark: No, you're not. Not hot.

Pepper Potts: Am I gonna be okay?

Tony Stark: No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.

Pepper Potts: And all your distractions?

Tony Stark: Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.

JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?

Tony Stark: You know what to do.

JARVIS: The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?

Tony Stark: Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. [Pepper and Tony hug as the Iron Man suits blow up.] Okay, so far? Do you like it?

Pepper Potts: It'll do.

Tony Stark (V.O): And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons.

Trevor Slattery: Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!

Tony Stark (V.O): But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you,[Metal clinking.] that was the best sleep I'd had in years.

Nurse: [Happy wakes up, gasping and coughing.] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

Happy Hogan: [Weak] No, look.

Tony Stark (V.O): [Throws Arc Reactor into the ocean.] So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man. [Thrilling music playing, credit scene.] You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.

Tony Stark: To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. [The camera zooms out to show Bruce Banner, asleep.] And the fact that you've been able to -help me process... [Tony stops and looks over as Bruce rubs his eyes.] Are you with me?

Bruce Banner: Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...

Tony Stark: Are you actively napping?

Bruce Banner: [Stammering] I was... I... I drifted.

Tony Stark: Where did I lose you?

Bruce Banner: Elevator in Switzerland.

Tony Stark: So, you heard none of it?

Bruce Banner: I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.

Tony Stark: So?

Bruce Banner: I don't have the...

Tony Stark: What? The time?

Bruce Banner: Temperament.

Tony Stark: You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?

Bruce Banner: Yes.

Tony Stark: I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.
