TJ - write the modified "classify.py" script which:
        input: name of a .csv  (ArizonaPolitics.csv)
        output: a written csv  (ArizonaPolitics_processed.csv)

VR/AK - locate all the freaking .csv files and run TJ's script on them all,
    which will create a number of _processed.csv files.

SD - where the heck are MY reddit threads?

SD - stick all the processed.csv files into one big .csv file
     load it
     create a MG
