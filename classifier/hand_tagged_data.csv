moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h15poei,">I honestly don't have an issue with this.  We often look for additional ways to punish prisoners and write it off as though they deserve whatever bad treatment they receive.  This just results in worse prison conditions and higher rates of recidivism.  The vast majority of people in prison are not abusing this system, they are using it to just get by and get things most people would consider as essentials.  \n\nThe article mentions 20 prisoners out of 129,000 that have large amounts.  That's about .015 percent, no i don't think this is a large or pressing issue.\n\nThe Justice department and BOP have different goals, I'm glad that the BOP is focused on their goal in this situation and not that of the Justice Dept. because that's how it should be.\n	>I see an issue in edge cases and feel a more moderate approach might be in order such as:\n	\n	* Cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n	* allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders. \n	* Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n	\n	I'm not worried about them but feel if it can be abused maybe we should have a bit more restrictions on them without an additional burden on the prisoner.\n		>It sounds more like there are a few exceptional cases and trying to find a solution for those few cases by painting it as a larger issue than it is.  Court orders already exist and are a valid way to enforce the judgements against prisoners.\n		\n		>cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n		\n		If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n		\n		>allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders.\n		\n		Sound like justifying violating the 4th amendment because the person is in prison.  They are already greatly limited in exercising their rights, but that doesn't excuse further abuses without a valid need when they are able to obtain a court order if needed.\n		\n		>Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n		\n		There's already limits on how much they can spend from these accounts.  Why more restrictions?  What is the problem that we are trying to solve here?\n			>Prisoners get shaken down and have their mail read. Why is looking at their financial activity less intrusive than throwing their mattress on the floor?\n				>Their cells are subject to inspection and searches due to the fact contraband could be physically concealed there.  Mail is inspected to check against smuggling contraband.  \n				\n				These are both safety issues to the prison and of the prisoners, how does their financial activity relate to physical safety?\n			>>If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n			\n			Well, if the accounts are shielded from things like child support or alimony orders, they could be an effective way to hide money and keep it from people legally entitled to it.\n				>Court orders are exist for this and are an effective tool.\n					>>	Federal prison inmates are keeping large sums of money — in some cases more than $100,000 each — in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders for things like child support, alimony or other debts, and not subject to the same scrutiny as accounts owned by non-incarcerated citizens, according to court documents and interviews.\n					\n					Literally the first paragraph of the article.\n",1623249865.0,2,hetero,no
moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h15fsuz,">This is like a couple dozen dollars per prisoner on average right?\n\nFeels like a lot of money but there's also a lot of people in prison in the USA.\n	>No solid data is known about the average. Here is relevant information based on the story.\n	\n	>Within the Federal Bureau of Prisons system, which houses roughly 129,000 inmates in facilities throughout the United States, there are more than 20 inmate accounts holding more than $100,000 each for a total exceeding $3 million, a person familiar with the program told The Washington Post.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Sometimes the sources are known, such as inmates cashing out their 401(k) retirement accounts or receiving payments from insurance policies. In other cases, it is less clear how the prisoner has amassed such funds. \n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>According to the individual familiar with the program, one of the biggest account holders is a disgraced former doctor with more than $250,000, while a former member of the military serving a life sentence for murder has more than $200,000.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Most prisoner accounts have only small sums of money.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Inmates can buy snacks and other goods in a prison’s commissary, but may not spend more than $360 a month there. Prisoners can also pay to make a limited number of phone calls or send a limited number of emails, though some of the restrictions have been eased during the coronavirus pandemic. And prisoners can send up to $100 a day to other people or have the government issue U.S. Treasury checks for any amount from their prison accounts.\n",1623245561.0,2,hetero,no
moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h159h8b,">Federal prison inmates do have a unique loophole. They can keep money in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders (child support, alimony, debts).\n\nThese accounts are not subject to criminal or regulatory scrutiny that could flag suspicious activity report because the agency is not considered a financial institution and does not run its bank transactions through a treasury department screening program.\n\nThe department of corrections says they have an [Inmate Financial Responsibility Program](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/BOP/e0023/intro.htm) that cannot force inmates to comply with state court orders but will incentivize them to do through privileges. The loophole in the Bureau of Prisons' policy is that they only accept federal court orders and not states.\n\nIn some cases, inmates were released from prison while the Justice Department was still trying to collect money. The Bureau of Prisons gave them debit cards with their account balances on them. The marshals had to track down the men to get their government-issued bank cards.\n\nA Tennessee bank robber asked a federal judge to order the $16,000 he owed in restitution to be taken from his prison account. A Bureau of Prisons staffer urged him not to pay the entire sum -- but rather to pay on a schedule of $100 a month (he would have paid off half of what was owed when he served his time)\n\nCongress has enacted a law that requires inmates to pay what they owe, but the Bureau of Prisons doesn't enforce that without specific court orders.\n\n*What is your thought about this type of arrangement?*\n\nIf you're **against it,** Why shouldn't inmates have money that they can spend for commentary, phone calls, etc. that would be protected from court orders?\n\nIf you're **for it**, Could a system like this be abused or even used as a bribery system for wealthy inmates?\n\n**On the fence**, what type of reform should we apply to this system?\n	>This seems kinda like a non-issue if the wealthiest prisoners (around 20) only have about 100K in their account. The issue with not protecting the little money they do have is in most prisons, prisoners are required to pay for a lot of their goods. If the state was allowed to zero out their accounts then they’d have no recourse because they wouldn’t be able to afford an attorney and they’d have no money to buy the goods they need.\n		>We agree that zeroing out their account is not something that should be done. That said, making this limitless system limited might allow a person to put money into a protected account while having excess money allow that be collectible. \n		\n		Doing away with excessive finds would be something I would be for but allowing sheltered bank accounts sounds like it could be ripe for abuse as well if you have enough money.\n			>Ripe for abuse is a non-concern when there are so many existing financial loopholes and non-compliance issues in use by people shielding much more than these 20 people's three million dollars.\n			\n			If we can use this as an excuse to get people with a hard-on for punitive justice on board to implement broad financial and tax reform in a way where actual loop holes and abuses are addressed, then I'm fine with this as rhetoric.\n			\n			Pretending it's a relevant existing issue that demands attention on its own is pretty silly though,  given those numbers.\n	>I think, as a side comment, there’s an argument for shielding prisoners from financial collections while they’re in custody, and sometime after. \n	\n	If the goal is rehabilitation, that cannot occur if someone is broke when they get out. Desperation is a motivation for some, but not all crimes - and while it’s no excuse, I would think that the social benefits of lower recidivism can outweigh the costs. \n	\n	I think of it similar to how collecting back rent from tenants is inherently difficult - the alternative is forcing people into homelessness, which has significantly higher societal costs.\n	>The article specifically references a Megan Bailey, in prison in Missouri on methamphetamine charges.\n	\n	I searches Missouri's court records, and found only Marijuana charges (and traffic violations) under that name. However, per the article:\n	\n	> Megan Bailey, a convicted methamphetamine dealer in Missouri, who was ordered to pay $250,000 as part of a 17-year prison sentence she received in 2019.\n	\n	It's possible Bailey was a drug 'kingpin', peddling large quantities and making large sums in the process. If that were the case, I'd expect to see at least local news articles. None such articles exist.\n	\n	What this tells me is this is *probably* (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure. Dealers typically make [~24,000 per year](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-07-11-9002260581-story.html) so the fine at least feels excessive.\n	\n	In situations like that one, allowing the state to take what little money she does have all but guarantees recidivism.\n	\n	So, even though the system could be (and most certainly is being) abused, until we take efforts to clean up the existing sentencing and fines structures, I have a hard time being angry about it.\n		>Be cautious using the lack of data as proof of anything other than you cannot find the data. I believe federal records are via PACER and not state websites as we are talking about a federal crime. (I'm not for sure.. if a Redditor with more info can reply to this comment that would be great)\n		\n		According to a website, I will not name (as it has her inmate number). Megan Bailey was incarcerated for Conspiracy to distribute Meth, Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime.\n		\n		While you're describing a separate problem (excessive fines) something we both agree and it is tangibly related. But the lack of regulation could have issues beyond excessive finds.  It also might be an invitation to use the money to bribe guards given the lack of safeguards on the money.\n			>250k is an absurd fine for distributing meth and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime.\n			\n			What did locking up Megan Bailey accomplish? There's still meth on the streets, it's extremely easy to get and very cheap. We've been locking up drug dealers under brutally harsh sentences for decades now and none of this has changed. \n			\n			The drug war is pointless cruelty.\n		>>What this tells me is this is probably (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure.\n		\n		What tells me this is probably *not* a relatively small crime is twofold:\n		\n		a) It's a federal incarceration and feds don't give a shit about low level street dealers that make minimum wage.\n		\n		b) The length of the sentence.  Federal sentencing is pretty straight forward - crimes are assigned base levels and there are modifiers that can add or subtract levels. Add up all the levels for all the crimes and you get a sentencing range.\n		\n		Receiving a 17 year sentence puts her between [levels 30 and 35](https://guidelines.ussc.gov/chapters/5/parts/A/sections) on the sentencing table depending on criminal history and other variables. To put that in perspective, there are only 43 levels total and the crime of trafficking methamphetamine of 12-30 **pounds** is a [level 34.](https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2018-guidelines-manual/2018-chapter-2-d)\n		\n		It probably wasn't just that and there were additional crimes like firearm possession.  But it's just not the case that this was your friendly dealer that lives down the hall at your dorm.\n			>[Apparently the median base level offense is a 32](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Methamphetamine_FY16.pdf) - which implies this person was at or near the median, plus the known possession of a firearm (+2). [Based on this](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-ut/legacy/2013/06/03/fedfacts%20for%20utah_web.pdf) the fine could be related to:\n			\n			> Unlawful for any person to place an advertisement in any newspaper,\n			magazine, handbill **or other publications** seeking or offering to illegally\n			receive, buy, or distribute any Schedule I controlled substance.\n			\n			Which carries a $250,000 fine. If I use an at-home printer to make an advert, and staple it to an electric pole - $250,000 fine.\n			\n			Hell, a business card could mean a $250,000 fine.\n				>>The median base offense level in these cases was 32. This corresponds to a quantity of drugs between 3.3 and 11.0 pounds of methamphetamine.\n				\n				Again, not a small crime.\n				\n				I find it pretty unlikely though that a drug trafficker at the level of moving pounds of meth was printing out advertisements at Office Depot and stapling them to telephone poles around the neighborhood.\n				\n				The reality is we have no idea why the fine was imposed, but the maximum fine for methamphetamine trafficking *by itself* is [$10 million.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30722.pdf)..  so Occam's Razor suggests it could simply have been for that.\n					>Per [this source](https://theconversation.com/most-us-drug-arrests-involve-a-gram-or-less-118440) using data from UC Davis Law Review, ~25% have more than 5 grams.\n					\n					These two aren't reconcilable. It cannot be the case that the median is < 5 grams and carries the penalty of ~7 lbs *unless* the median is skewed by non-drug-mass related characteristics.\n					\n					What those are is hard to tell, but the assertion that she was carrying 3.3 to 11 *pounds* doesn't comport with the statistics we have.\n						>The error you’re making is conflating federal drug prosecutions with all state and local drug prosecutions.\n",1623242365.0,2,hetero,no
moderatepolitics,t3_nvgd2h,h13bl5i,">What is it with these blue states in New England, electing moderate red governors? IIRC, there was a post here recently about the Republican governor of Vermont. That’s my biggest unanswered question in this article.\n\nIn theory, it has the potential to prevent the state GOP from drifting too far to the right. Living in a red state where the state party often threatens to tar and feather the governor of its own party for not being Trumpy enough, I don’t know that it will work that way.\n	>Part of it has to do with open primaries. Something like 70% of massachusetts voters are registered as independent. Often people will vote for the candidate that they see as less bad of the opposition so it encourages more moderate candidates at the state level. Also there isn't the massive ideological divide in Massachusetts that there is in the rest of the country. Fiscally moderate and socially liberal describes a lot of people here. Also the fact that the largest religion group in mass Catholics tend to vote Democrat eats away at the support for a more socially conservative candidate. The state GOP as an organization might be behind Trump but there are enough moderates and liberals here that nominating a candidate that openly espouses Trump's views would hand the election to even the most boring democratic candidate\n	>I think it's more the other direction. Democrats have the run of our legislature, so people like to vote for Republicans in the Governorship to keep them in check. We don't really care much about the state GOP here, they're kind of a joke. Lyons is nuts if he thinks going full Trump is going to help them though.\n		>I mean it’s unfair to characterize him as a moderate republican. He’s really a moderate Democrat with an R next to his name. This article almost reads like the onion. “The GOP should take advice from the rights most liked politician by leftists”.\n		>Not exactly. The MA Democratic is not exactly known for being progressive; a lot of progressives and leftists have called out the party for being a corrupt establishment party that's interested in self-preservation. One only needs to look at the dirty tricks employed against Alex Morse to see how corrupt the state party is. \n		\n		https://newrepublic.com/article/161406/charlie-baker-massachusetts-democratic-party-failure\n			>Oh yeah, part of the reason is that informed voters don't trust the party for unilateral rule. The progressive thing is just what I hear as a reason that people say they voted R for Gov. Much of our more progressive stuff has come out of referendums and pressure from the public.\n	>They elect Republican governors because they balance the worse impulses of the Supra-majority legislatures.\n	>Is it really that unique?  \n	\n	While often blue, places like California, Massachusetts, Baltimore, Vermont, and New York have had Republican governors in relatively recent history.\n		>These guys wouldn't even be Republicans in, like, North Carolina.\n		>Ah yes, the good old state of Baltimore\n	>You'll get a lot of the 'balance' theories in response to that, but this implies and intentionality that I don't agree is there. The bottom line is that most of these 'blue states' aren't actually blue.\n	\n	For example, with Massachusetts, you can see [here](https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/03/19/massachusetts-past-election-results) that the state is split about 2:1 Democrat vs Republican, but there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n	\n	So in an environment where 1 out of every 3 voters are Republican to begin with, it only takes a few other factors to tip an election. Those factors could be (note that I don't know if these are true, but they seem to match the data):\n	\n	* Republicans tend to be older and thus more of them vote.\n	* Conservative Democrats are often turned off by the candidates that Democrats in that state nominate.\n	* The state has had a string of Republican governors that were widely respected, endorsing each other on the way out.\n	* The Republican party has focused its support on that race\n	* As speculated elsewhere in this post, people could prefer someone as executive that balances out the super-majority of Democrats in other branches.\n	\n	If any two of these are true it could be enough to push the race over the edge, but if I had to guess, I'd be willing to bet that most of them are true.\n		>> there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n		\n		The smaller ones do, and not very many.  On your list, the most populous district that leans red is Billerica at something like 30th place, population-wise.  Next one is Westfield, another 10 places down.  You can expect the smallest towns to vote conservative, but not many people live there.\n	>It's the people. They have an identity crisis. Have you been to Boston? Everyone is staunchly liberal but ridiculously conservative. They will preach about the good of homeless shelters but make sure to block any attempts to build one within 10 miles of them. They will promote racial equality but then only hire white people. They actually worked for years to shut down the only gay nightclub in Boston until they finally did it.

Tbh these days he could easily pass for a more right wing Democrat.\n\nBut another thing that caught my eye was the increasingly Trumpification of state GOP organisations. They’re very intent about influencing the direction of the state GOPs even at the cost of losing power.\n	>Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts. As a resident of the state most people I talk to either like the guy or are ambivalent. There are definitely those who are open to fiscal conservatives amongst the younger generation as balancing the budget is a generally popular proposal. However anyone more socially to the right wouldn't have a path to state office. There does seem to be this almost libertarian bent around here no matter which side of the aisle you are on with a distrust of the power of the federal government in general. This state will elect whoever promises to pass a balanced budget and changes the status quo the least.\n		>> Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts.\n		\n		The article says that Mass. has been electing Republicans governors regularly for the last sixty years\n			>That's fair I should be probably said in this current political climate. I don't think anyone that is riding the current wave of trump populism would not have a shot in this state for instance. The man in your tag Ike would still be able to win in Massachusetts for example. But it requires a very moderate republican by today's standards to carry the state. Any hint of right of center social views generally loses you the election before it starts. Republicans win here by staying away from social issues entirely and promising to balance the budget and promote the states rights over the federal government. All of them have been generally popular here too with the exception of Romney at the end when he decided to spend the 2nd half of his term campaigning for president and handing the Democrats the seat on beacon hill.\n			>West Virginia had been electing Democratic governors regularly for the last several decades too but that doesn't mean Democrats really stood a good shot in 2020 or will in 2024.

Fact: more people AND businesses leave California each year due to overregulation, high taxes, high cost of living, superficial Hollywood newcomers, overcrowding, my God, there must be much more! I’m sorry it wasn’t contained in California, the disease has spread certainly and regrettably to Washington state, Oregon and Colorado. It has spread to most other states as well. It was clearly done - it seems like certain companies that attract a certain type of people decided to set up camp in the most densely populated cities thus infecting most large cities. The infection also emanates from schools of all grades through university. The talk was BIG: The media was bought, all 6 major companies organized through ProPublica to coordinate local, regional and national news sources. Corporate was bought to push the agenda through policy in ads, social media, employees. Polls were bought to see the real results and relay false results.\n	\n	The talk was so BIG it fooled the average sheep. \n	\n	\n	We later learned that whole branches of government AND government agencies had failed to protect our checks and balances as hours and hours of testimony and physical hard evidence of voting and election fraud were collected and made public. The media with 95% control of all media withheld the information. Luckily some trickled through.\n	\n	Biden campaigned the least of any political candidate in the history of the United States. Pulled the least number of supporters to rallies (and video views for covid paranoids). The rap sheet for the crime, the motive, lack of sincerity and admission of guilt on video uttered by his own mouth + Time Magazine’s own admission show that the guy cheated and did not win lawfully. The Supreme Court was supposed to hear the court cases even if to still deny the doubt of election integrity. Were they bribed? threatened? Or worse? Was it to prevent a civil war? Shut the BLM and Antifa up? To protect the citizens? Are lives more important? What did the veterans of all prior wars die for then? To allow socialism, tyranny, communism? To allow hundreds if not thousands kill themselves with this endless present? Alcohol, suicide, extreme poverty, depression, isolation. Not allowed to socialize? Congregate for religion? Kids developing social anxiety? and not learning in school anymore? Learning Marxism? Learning to hate their country? That they are racist before they even know what that is?\n	\n	Truth is all we got. We have been fighting the communist war since March 2020. Biological warfare resulting in a healthcare state. The medical field is plagued by parties holding a stake in the money made. Workers are deluding themselves about how it really is - they went through the schooling and depend on their job to live. Others are making a pretty penny off incentives to diagnose covid positive. Insurance billing, supplies, pharma, hospitals, doctors. How much did you pay for a rapid test before your flight to Boston where they say you must pass the test before your flight - some paid $400!!!! BTW - no one checks for it!!!! Yes, no one asked for it! Gotcha!!! And only 1 WHOLE YEAR later, they just decided they got too many false positives and turned the PCR thermocycler cycles down. Magically! The number of cases are down! BTW we got reports early on that they constantly had false positives. Yes, too many bad apples were bought and paid for, killed or somehow silenced to not speak the truth.\n	\n	The average sheep bought the whole BS To cheat the election using all means used in the past (exemplified and perfected in California and New York) and using as many mail in ballots as physically needed. The people today had more information than at anytime in the past. Many played stupid and all suffered the consequences. This is a lesson for Libertarians. You can’t just let the government run itself and expect it to not get out of control at some point. It’s gone WAY WAY haywire!\n	\n	I’m sorry my friend!

In AZ, they timed the legislation to end when the current Dem SoS's term is over; it's blatant.\n			\n			Beyond that, the gerrymandering in the pipeline will likely give the House to GOP, and it's pretty clear that they won't certify the next President unless they are a Republican.\n			\n			The suppression is bad, but the groundwork being laid for outright fuckery combined with an apparently clear willingness to use it is what's scaring the shit out of us.\n				>Jamey, is that you?\n				>You're right.

That's what worries me, not fantasy scenarios about throwing out elections.\n					\n					Since 2020, Dems have done a lot of winning at the local and state levels. Just last week, they over performed Biden in a race for Congress that the GOP would have loved to win. Last night, they overperformed Biden in a State House race in New Hampshire - despite a bunch if outside spending.

conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h15aqjp,">I have followed CJ for awhile now. He is an impressive, dare I say, kid.\n	>Not long enough, apparently.\n	\n	I’d let him finish growing up before celebrating him; he’s already been through full grift cycles. Became famous for alleging that Obama had blocked him on Twitter but it turned out he was lying. Was hired as Ted Cruz’ youth director out of that. Turned himself into a consultant and scammed a bunch of money out of other young Republicans that wanted a national voice like he had, doing virtually nothing to help them but taking their money anyway. When that came out, he was fired. Then he dropped out of Republican circles and went to work for Bernie Sanders as a youth person. Dunno what happened there, but now he’s back as a Republican activist. \n	\n	Kid’s young, so I’m not going to hold ancient behavior against him for forever, I just think he’s still young enough that his history warrants a bit of caution.\n		>Wow, I wasn't aware of that at all. That's crazy. How can you consider yourself a conservative and support Bernie Sanders? lmao. Kid is obviously a little confused and maybe is still trying to find his own identity.\n			>It’s easy if you have no principles and are just out for yourself.\n				>Or, if you are young and malleable and susceptible to any new idea that sounds like it's a good one at face value.\n					>Certainly but it seems like his goal is not the cause, but rather money and clout.\n						>That’s quite the assumption\n							>One assumption deserves another.\n					>Or you are a grifter….\n				>I think that qualifies him as solidly conservative.\n		>Yeah, I would be cautious with him. He's as fickle as the wind.\n		>That smile is pretty infectious. Must be crazy to have that much charisma.\n		>Do you remember why he renounced conservatism, and how old he was? That was 5 years, maybe a little more. He was 13 I think. At the time he was taking flak for being a black conservative, even only at 13. He was getting hit left and right with 'why are you standing up for the racist party.' type things. A popular 13 year old 'youtube star' in politics getting blasted because he is a conservative black kid on a liberal medium. Of course he questioned what he was doing!   \n		\n		\n		And let's be honest, what 13 year old, even in politics, doesn't find Bernie Sanders fascinating. The dude has great promises and makes it sound like he can usher in a prosperous future. Of course he was drawn to that. Did you ever think that maybe Bernie is the reason CJ ended back on the Republican side?\n		\n		So many teenagers who are conservatives are constantly surrounded by hostile politics. Think of all the liberals around them. School, media, video games, and friends. The fact that he dabbled in another ideology, let alone a super popular one at the time, is not unheard of at all. In the past 3 years, he has been a good voice for Republicans.  \n		\n		One more thing, he did indeed do everything you said, but I tell you what, all those things are very huge characteristics of a politician. Possibly a good one, but we will see. We all make mistakes, especially as kids. So far, his mistakes are very forgivable and can be chalked up to learning experiences. To my knowledge, he has not replicated any of the bad mistakes.\n			>I think flip-flopping and grifting makes a terrible politician. He has charisma and confident speaking skills, which make for smooth politicians, not necessarily good legislators.\n			\n			I specifically noted that I wouldn’t hold it against him forever and that I’m not saying he should be blackballed, just that an ounce of caution is warranted considering his history and that I think he should be given the grace of anonymity to finish growing up/figuring out what he actually believes. Money talks. He clearly knows that. It’s a lot tougher to be certain of his political convictions when he’s not been consistent through obscurity or difficulty.\n			\n			Maybe he will be consistently conservative the rest of his life. Only time will tell— and that’s all I’m saying. Don’t celebrate him yet. Be cautious. If he’s still consistent in five years, then I’ll be much more willing to count his young missteps as just that.\n	>He's way too grown to be called a kid...

Conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h155ab6,">Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does. It's one thing to say this theory is so extreme it can't be taught in K-12, which is focused on giving minors a basic education. It's another thing to advocate banning it on college campuses. College should be about the open exchange of ideas and rather than advocate banning it, Pearson should learn it and challenge it head on in debate.\n	>By this logic, universities should be teaching witchcraft and flat earth theory too.\n	\n	They don't teach those topics because they are obviously wrong, why would we make an exception to CRT?\n		>I think that this is an unfair comparison. No modern day politician believes in witchcraft, but many modern day politicians believe in Critical Race Theory. Even then, if we look at something like pure Communism via the 1850 manifesto, no one believes in that exact document anymore. Everyone who believes in Communist-esque ideology now is a neo-Marxist, neo-Leninist, or some pretty removed form from the original document. I bring this up to mention that people still teach classes on Marx's *Communist Manifesto* even though no one believes in that form of 'government' for lack of a better word.\n		\n		I think that it is fair to ban classes from teaching critical race theory in high schools, as it is a highly politicized topic, difficult to opt out of, very niche regarding much of history, and risks taking too much of a hardline 'this is the way that it happened' as opposed to just making it an idea that some people believe.\n		\n		I do not believe that it should be banned or even left out of from (optional) colleges curriculums however. In college, it is an opt in choice, and students' minds are far less malleable. Also, most people who take a course on critical race theory will be people who will be political scientists or history majors. Teaching highschool students as a whole is very different from teaching just history majors and political scientists, if they choose to listen.\n		\n		To summarize my feelings on the topic, I think that Critical Race Theory is a poor way to look at history, as it does not really allow for solutions. In spite of this, you have to remember when ideas are banned, you create unmoderated, underground groups of radicals. I would rather have the idea be taught at universities in the public eye where discourse can take place, than foster radical groups that promote unadulterated versions of their ideas.\n		>Some universities do teach witchcraft (history of it anyway) and discuss flat earth theory as a theory when discussing history.\n		\n		These were kind of bad examples to your point.  Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well, should be ban those?\n		\n		Banning the discussion of a subject or theory from academia just makes it taboo, and could even cause the inverse effect where more people seek it out considering it's now 'forbidden'.\n		\n		All theories should be up for discussion in post-secondary education.  It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			>Teaching *about* a theory is very different from teaching a theory as being correct.\n				>I agree, I didn't say I wanted CRT taught exactly the way it's being taught, I'm just saying outright banning the subject from even discussion at universities seems like a step too far.\n				\n				Again, banning something rarely gets rid of it, it just drives it underground.\n			>>It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			\n			Congratulations for contradicting your whole argument and making my argument for me.\n			\n			Do you honestly believe these CRT courses are looking at the topic in an objective, historical comparison? Have you seen any of the reading material or seen any speakers?\n			\n			Honestly, they have it set up brilliantly. They lecture you on how the entire premise of the country is flawed, and anything that goes against that narrative is used as evidence that the narrative exists.\n			\n			If you try to refute the goals of the founders using, idk their letters and articles from the time, then they just accuse you of defending the 'racist' system they founded.\n				>Except schools are teaching it as a serious established theory that you should consider believing yourself. The entire program is to convince you of its merits. Witchcraft classes don’t have that approach.\n			>> Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well\n			\n			Do they now ? Because most of the college people I've talked with apparently have little to no idea what any of those are.\n				>I can't speak for everyone but when I attended undergraduate my political science classes discussed the differences in ideology quite extensively as well as their similarities.\n				\n				Admittedly it's been about 16 years since I went to Undergrad, and my graduate degree is an MBA, so not much political science there.\n		>We don't need the government to ban the teaching of flat Earth or witchcraft.\n			>That's not really my point.\n			\n			Why aren't universities open to teaching those topics? Shouldn't they teach anything by your logic?\n			\n			Remember, universities are government sustained. You can easily make the argument when a university takes a position on something, they are backed by the government.\n				>Private universities aren’t public \n				\n				Colleges already essentially teach whatever they want including about those subjects\n				\n				It’s up to the faculty, administration, and students. Not the government. It’s academic freedom, something that we should take care not to infringe\n		>No, by that logic universities should be banned from teaching it, which was his point. Universities teach the bible too, which is just as wrong in many places.\n			>Universities teach the history of the bible and deconstruct the ideas behind it. Same thing with Islam.\n			\n			They don't convert the students to those religions in those courses like they do in CRT. In my experience, classes teaching about religion are more likely to promote atheism in the students than a more positive outlook on religion.\n				>Religious universities, which receive federal and state money, do teach it as truth. But you ignored his point, which is that the government shouldn't be involved in banning university curricula.\n		>Okay, I'm very much against CRT. But, I don't like the idea of seeing anything as 'obviously wrong' in an academic setting. Maybe it's my education background in STEM, but much of the innovation we make comes from things we once considered obviously wrong.   \n		\n		\n		There are pros and cons when information is free to be discussed.\n			>Then you've killed the entire purpose of higher education. \n			\n			If our universities, publicly funded by the way, start teaching 2+2=5 because we no longer believe in objective truth, than higher education is worthless.\n			\n			CRT is entirely based on numerous false premises. The idea that the nation's very foundation is racist, is false. The idea that we are nothing more than the average of our intersectional/post-modernist identity groups, is false. The idea that western society is the genesis for all evil in the world right now, is totally false. Honestly, Santa Claus is more believable than CRT.\n				>Don't spend a fucking paragraph explaining why something is bad that I've stated I don't endorse. It's pointless. And, no, not all universities are publicly funded.\n				\n				The ideas of Plank, Bohr, Shrodinger, Einstein, Oppenheimer, etc were all considered obviously wrong and based on incorrect presuppositions. When it turned out that the prevailing presuppositions were wrong. I'm not here defending CRT. I'm here defending the idea that the mainstream 'correct' think is not always right. And, using the 2+2=5 analogy brings a level of irony into this, as an adage to 1984. Freedom is the freedom to say 2+2=4. If that is granted, all else follows.\n				\n				'Right think' is being advocated on both sides and it's not just detrimental, it's downright authoritarian. The antidote to bad ideas isn't banning them. It's challenging them with good ideas. We used to believe this, at one point.\n	>So far I've seen laws, at least in the Oklahoma one, they don't really '' ban it'', they just forbid making it's teaching obligatory. They can still teach this kind of garbage, but they can't force you to take the class, nor they can make your grades depend on it.\n	>Just to gauge where your lines would be; do you feel that should apply to tax-funded public schools, or only privately funded ones? Do you also advocate for the teaching of sexism in universities? Or just racism? Because CRT literally advocates for (actually) institutionalized racism. \n	\n	I totally get your point! That the idea of 'cancelling' ideas we don't like makes us not much better than the unhinged lefties! Consider though, that the idea of suppressing abhorrent and dangerous world views isn't new. We 'cancelled' tf outta Hitler for using CRT to 'other' the Jews. Do we not generally try to eliminate, or *cancel* racism? How would opposing CRT be any different than opposing any *other* form of racism? I'm just trying to figure out if you support the idea of teaching racism in general, or if this one specific form just feels different to you somehow. \n	\n	As easy as the idea of standing idly by allowing evil to thrive sounds, sometimes in life we've gotta stand up for our principles. Assuming we have any. Sometimes good *has* to cancel evil, or we condemn entire future generations to the consequence of our complacency. It's not really the same as trying to ruin someones career and life because they uttered some word 20 years ago that we don't like.\n		>Frankly, I would do away with government education in the first place. There should be a separation of education and state. \n		\n		Having said that, the government did not ban National Socialist ideology. In fact, many progressives thought fascism was great in the 1920's and 1930's. Communists opposed the fascists, until the Hitler-Stalin pact and then fascism was fine. Until the war anyway. After National Socialism had been defeated and the horrors of death camps discovered the government didn't need to ban Nazism or eugenics, these doctrines were naturally abandoned. \n		\n		I would much rather conservatives win the debate on campus than use the power of the state to unjustly banish ideas we don't like.\n	>>	Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does.\n	\n	Like what? Let’s hear some examples.\n		>I think that He means to say that the left de-platform those that they disagree with, which is similar, although not exactly the same, as de-platforming an idea. To give an example of that, although I know that you didn't exactly ask for this, Richard Dawkins being de-platformed for his 'offensive' ideas on Islam.\n	>Lots of misunderstanding of the word theory in these discussions. Theory means it’s been tested rigorously enough to be accepted by the scientific community. Theory is conflated with hypothesis, which is the untested phase. A theory is all but proven. Evolution is a theory because it’s been tested. \n	\n	Flat-Earth is NOT A THEORY. It has no evidence or scientific consensus. \n	\n	CRT, while I don’t know much about it, I doubt it is supported enough to be a true theory. \n	\n	If we talk about banning anything, ban calling it a theory and giving it the scientific recognition that comes with that word. \n	\n	It’s bad enough people thinking evolution is “just a theory”.\n		>Theory in a liberal arts context is essentially a tested hypothesis and by tested I mean discussed and accepted by at least some group within the liberal arts world. In the case of CRT, it's been around for awhile now and has been adopted by numerous people as true. The problem is that there has been little to no pushback in academia because conservatives are grotesquely outnumbered and are actively denied admissions into Ph.D programs and tenure tracks. Conservative media is over a decade behind on this issue, CRT has been accepted and pervasive on college campuses and in K-12 for some time now.\n	>It’s not an actual “theory”.

That's the first thing to understand about why the more traditionally more left wing parties like Labour moved to the centre.  Thatcherism was pretty popular across the English speaking world at the time, and third way politics was considered the best way to adapt to what was popular at the time.  So that necessitated a move to the right and away from more traditional socialist values (that most people in these parties didn't have anyway) in order to get elected.  Which, referring back to rule one, is all that matters in the end.  In Canada the Chretien Liberals (really it was all Paul Martin) inherited a nasty debt and had no choice but to make big spending cuts.

Ask_Politics,t3_o2ibkb,h284474,">Basically, Reaganites. That's why. In the 80s in both the US and the UK, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had a similar brand of politics that deeply captured a whole generation. Reagan in particular not only DESTROYED his competition, but he also transformed his party and codified the future for modern conservatives. As Reagan turned over to his successors, he left politics but his influence remained. Society as a whole got a whole lot more supportive of extreme emphasis on the private sector and other economically right ideas, and for left of center folks to remain competitive, they had to move right on these issues. Clinton's shift to the right was a matter of self-preservation. Thatcher had a similar effect.\n\nNow, Reaganites are starting to get to be a bit older and their influence is waning as Millennials start to become of voting age. Plus, history hasn't been kind to Reaganite economic ideas, which has helped make these pushes to right seem unfavorable looking back.\n	>I would like to point out that 'Millennials' are mostly in their 30s, with some of us pushing 40. We have to do better to stop conflating millennials with Gen Z...we millennials have been of voting age for quite a while. Unfortunately, we are just unreliable voters, at least here in the States, because both our center-right party, the Democrats, and extremist-right party, the Republicans, are unpalatable and uninspiring because they are extremely out of touch. My generation is the largest voting bloc but the median age of Congress is 60, and with quite a few members pushing 90. It's also difficult for my generation to take over because there's still the GenXers and Xennials and my generation only controls about 2% of all of society's wealth - being that the Boomers are living much longer and refusing to step aside.\n	\n	The lurch into Gerontocracy is one of the most toxic and undiscussed burdens on our society, but that is a discussion for another time. Point is: anyone born after 1996 is not a millennial and saying millennials are coming of voting age is not only wrong, it's kind of derogatory and belittling.\n		>\>I would like to point out that 'Millennials' are mostly in their 30s, with some of us pushing 40.\n		\n		Yes, I know we're now official kinda old people, and kinda old people vote, young people don't. The reason that opinion on Reagan has started to sour so quickly over the last few years is because more 'young' folks are hitting political maturity--early to late 30s. Folks younger than that don't vote reliably enough to be a real bloc that can compete. Gen Z still has 10 years or so before their adults start being a force as a voting bloc.\n		\n		\>Unfortunately, we are just unreliable voters, at least here in the States, because both our center-right party, the Democrats, and extremist-right party, the Republicans, are unpalatable and uninspiring because they are extremely out of touch.\n		\n		I don't agree with this. I think more and more Millennials are coming to a better understanding of politics where they are moving away from that excessively ideological purist view. Millennials are becoming *more* reliable and starting to change the paradigm because they're going out to vote for whichever candidate they *most* like. I think you're describing your experience, but overall Millennials are jumping into the voting population at about the same age and about the same force as previous generations.\n		\n		\>being that the Boomers are living much longer and refusing to step aside.\n		\n		Right. The real issue here is that even when Millennials get involved, they're outnumbered by the Boomers and the Boomers aren't dying or retiring. Which, I get, and they shouldn't be forced to irrelevant themselves...but you're right that these are folks increasingly not invested in the future and are still the most powerful voting bloc and that's a very bad combination for society.\n		\n		So let me be clear: I'm saying millennials are coming of age politically. Most young adults don't get into politics right away. 20 somethings don't vote. Sure, SOME do, but not enough to make a generational stamp on politics. Every time a candidate tries to 'motivate the youth vote' he loses unless he's making a base in a different demographic. The rise of Pete Buttigieg was fueled almost entirely by 30-40 year old moderates and weak progressives--that's millennials. Buttigieg had the second strongest performance of any candidate.\n			>I concur with most of your comment, as a millennial whose voted in every election since I turned 18, my generation are a frustrating bunch - but you're right, my generation is starting to become more politically active, but as a left-wing voter myself (Bernie Sanders is center-left in my view), and one who's heavily involved in left-wing grassroots organizing, most center-lefters and left-wing voters still find both of our parties unpalatable, but the two party system is irredeemable and entrenched, and most of my compatriots aren't becoming less ideologically purist per se, we just know that to stop the extreme-right swing we can't afford to sit out on elections, even though I wish we would've came to our senses 4 years ago.... I vote Democrat but I'm still not a huge fan - though I am pleasantly surprised at Biden's willingness to open the door to progressives and leftists, yet the gerontocracy that is Congress is virtually intransigent for any policy left of hunting the homeless for sport (hyperbole, but you'll get my point).\n			\n			Anyway, more narrowly, my comment was coming from a place of frustration with Millennials not being given the proper respect, and still being thought of as kids. Certainly nothing in my comment is meant to detract from your overall points, most of which I agree with - even if I may not like it. There is one exception, however, in that I think Buttigieg's rise was more fueled by a large sect of Gen Zers, who are notably less left-leaning than my generation. But I haven't looked at the data so this is just conjecture.\n				>\>but as a left-wing voter myself (Bernie Sanders is center-left in my view), and one who's heavily involved in left-wing grassroots organizing, most center-lefters and left-wing voters still find both of our parties unpalatable, but the two party system is irredeemable and entrenched, and most of my compatriots aren't becoming less ideologically purist per se, we just know that to stop the extreme-right swing we can't afford to sit out on elections, even though I wish we would've came to our senses 4 years ago....\n				\n				Two things. One, you happen to ascribe to the most purist part of the Dems and I imagine you surround yourself with a greater than average amount of folks who think similarly. That's not a criticism--most of us attract people like ourselves, which is exactly why anecdotal evidence is so unreliable. So I think you're probably seeing more purity than there actually is, just like it's possible I'm seeing less (though I'd say most of the data support my reading more than yours). \n				\n				Two, even here you're admitting that there is more pragmatism and less purity over time even in your particular group. I'm a millennial that was calling out Sanders folks hard in 2016 for precisely the kind of thinking you're lamenting 4 years ago. I'm by no means saying that millennials are hardcore two party system fans, but I'm saying the same thing you're saying.\n				\n				\>though I am pleasantly surprised at Biden's willingness to open the door to progressives and leftists, yet the gerontocracy that is Congress is virtually intransigent for any policy left of hunting the homeless for sport\n				\n				Yes, this is what myself and other moderates have been saying about Biden ever since the beginning of the primaries and Sanders folks didn't want to hear it...but I digress. I think the issue you're hitting on is less a matter of gentocracy and more a matter of anti-majoritarian features of our system creating gridlock to an extreme degree. Plenty of really old folks are committed to major structural change--in fact, I think you could argue that the modern progressive momentum doesn't exist without Old Man Sanders and Old Bird Warren laying the path. The problem is that change of any kind requires on a level of consensus that is not reasonable to expect in any free society.\n				\n				\>There is one exception, however, in that I think Buttigieg's rise was more fueled by a large sect of Gen Zers, who are notably less left-leaning than my generation. But I haven't looked at the data so this is just conjecture.\n				\n				Yeah, take a look and you'll see that Buttigieg's base was youngish white folks who were mostly moderate but also kinda open to progressive politics. Basically, he cannibalized Warren's base, which is one reason Warren never got off on the right foot. You can see she started to realize this halfway through as in one of the debates she went after Buttigieg HARD and he held his own (I think it was the debate before she eviscerated Bloomberg). Of course, there are ton of millennial voters that were also fueling the Sanders/AOC side of the party. But if anyone was after Gen Z it was Sanders, both in 2016 and 2020, and in both cases he wasn't able to pull through because even though these guys are in their late teens and early 20s, most folks don't politically mature until after that (some vote still, but lots of the time they vote the same as their parents). \n				\n				I, too, get bent out of shape when folks bash on millennials for no reason and still think of us as being kids. Hell, I just had a kid myself! Political maturation just tends to happen well after regular coming of age. That's all I meant.\n",1624033349.0,2,hetero,no
Ask_Politics,t3_o2ibkb,h28p0it,">I'm guessing I'll be in disagreement with most of posters here, as I consider 'paradigm shifts' to be the consequence (rationalization), rather than the motive force of social changes. \n\nBut if I am to rely on my own experience, I can't sum up main reason as anything but 'fall of USSR'.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat you consider 'left-wing' (or economically left) position is centrist (or SocDem), as the whole point of it is to support status quo, even if it means sacrificing interests of one group or the other. Actual Left has alternative to status quo. Centre doesn't.\n\nThe general dynamic that kept Centre in power in most of 20th century was based on sacrificing actual left (socialist) policies to reach an agreement with capitalists (i.e. rich elite; not whatever can be considered 'capitalist' ideologically in US).\n\nBasically, you have some broad coalition (formal or informal, doesn't really matter) of 'united left' that presents some threat to status quo. Centrists then use this 'united left' to negotiate with capitalists, so as to acquire some concessions ('if you don't agree to our demands, bad evil communists might start a revolution or present much harsher demands').\n\nThis was the main drive of First World politics since Weimar republic (at the very least; the same dynamic can be applied to UK Liberal Party pre-WW1 and so on).\n\nHowever, there is a major problem with such a dynamic: if Left movements consistently fail to reach their goals, then people start going straight to centrists (as it is centrists who end up 'doing' actual things), weakening Left in process. But if Left  weakens, then it can't provide strong bargaining position to the Centre: centrists don't have anything to threaten capitalists with. Consequently, centrists have no option but to choose among themselves the most economically radical members to throw them under the bus together with proper socialists.\n\nI.e. the ultimate result of this dynamic is constant shift of political balance to the Right.\n\n* This dynamic doesn't work in the opposite direction as capitalists have a stream of wealth that can be invested into politics to sustain right-wing parties even if said parties never reach their goals.\n\nWhen Soviet Union was around, this shift was somewhat alleviated by its presence: even outside of direct support there was an example of Left politics providing practical results. Hence, there was a certain trickle of people into the Left.\n\nHowever, as Soviets started to weaken, First World Left started to lose ground as well. *Zastoi* period weakened position of centrists to the level that they lost to open Right-wingers (Thatcher and Reagan). Subsequent collapse of USSR (that begun with *Perestroika*) ensured that Left would not regain its power, and that there would be no return to the old compromise: capitalists would not accept it, as they have no reason to fear any revolutions.\n\nAnd this is how the dynamic I described above started to define politics since the 1990s: to get back into power, centrist politicians (ex. Blair) sacrificed economic demands and doubled-down instead on 'social' (as those do not really concern capitalists, while can be presented as some kind of 'achievement' to general population).\n",1624042710.0,3,homo,no

What really is different, though, is our preexisting culture.  Whether its due to our Scandinavian roots or some other factor, we are a people that are pretty dedicated to doing right by our neighbors, and civically engaging.  For instance, we've had the highest voter turnout in every election going back as far as I can remember; In 2020 [we nearly hit 80%!](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/voter-turnout-by-state)  I'd really be interested in seeing if there was a correlation between voting rates and vaccine hesitancy, now that we're talking about it...\n	>There could be some correlation between the high voter turnout,  trust in institutions, and low vaccine hesitancy. \n	\n	One thing I'll add is that you should be skeptical of the data because it shows such strong state-line effects. Fargo, ND and Moorhead, MN have a combined MSA and you should expect there to be a much more smooth change in vaccine hesitancy.\n		>> One thing I'll add is that you should be skeptical of the data because it shows such strong state-line effects.\n		\n		That raised my eyebrow too: from [the methodology document](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265341/vaccine-hesitancy-COVID-19-Methodology.pdf), the underlying data is from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey which is used to estimate state-level vaccine hesitancy rates.  So those should be pretty robust.\n		\n		Then they used demographic data to see how vaccine hesitancy depends on each, and applied those to PUMA- and county-level demographic data.  Which I daresay still leaves the county-level estimates dominated by the state-level estimates, since while e.g. Cass County where Moorhead is has different American Community Survey (ACS) demographics to Minnesota as a whole, they're just not *that* different so you will only tend to get in-state variation as far as the demographics swing from county to county **and** the vaccine hesitancy varies between those demographics.\n		\n		Plus, political leanings are *not* among the demographics available via the ACS, while [there's a pretty strong correlation there.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html)\n		>I'd like to point out that with regards to the [hhs estimates](https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) there are some methodological quirks that make that map and the map [circulating yesterday by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/covid-herd-immunity-vaccine.html) potentially misleading. \n		\n		\n		[The methodology can be found here](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265341/vaccine-hesitancy-COVID-19-Methodology.pdf). \n		\n		These estimates of vaccine hesitancy were created using a logistic regresssion and used these measures as estimators: age, gender, race, education, marital status, health insurance status, income levels, **state**, with interaction between race and education level. \n		\n		State to me is odd because this gives very defined borders to states. Niaevely I'd assume since this issue has become somewhat polarized with dems (in general) being more likely to get the vaccine that this map should sort of mirror a population map with more dense populations wanting the vaccine with more rural areas not wanting/needing the vaccinee due to proximity. \n		\n		Going back to the variables it's basically MRP without the PUMA-level (Public Use Microdata Areas) effects or any real continuous effects at all. Leading to some really disjointed state lines. Because of the inclusion of state in the predictive model, I'm not even sure if this should be displayed at the county level or just at the state level. Add this to the releativly new and untested pulse data and I'm not sure this is useful at all.\n			>Yeah the model is clearly using state as a major factor in the estimate.

Second, we applied the regression coefficients from the HPS analysis to the data from the ACS to predict hesitancy rates for each ACS respondent ages 18 and older.

So this Policy review is from June 18, 2019.**\n\nThe topic is should the prison population have access to air conditioning?\n\nSome at least 13 states (some states have no data on this): Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisianna, Mississippi, Missouri, N. Carolina, S. Caroline, Texa, Virginia lack AC.\n\nWhy is AC needed? Because people who are incarcerated have various health conditions, some that can make dehydration and heat stroke a higher risk. Conditions like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, or psychotropic medication. This has in the past led to deaths from inadequate cooling.\n\nSome states refuse air conditioning as an appearance to be tough on crime. But Wisconsin, Arizona, Mississippi have already ruled that incarceration in extremely hot or cold temperatures violates the eight amendments.\n\nA few things to ask the community:\n\n* We never hear that prisons don't install heating (I'm from the northern states); why is AC any different?\n* Is the lack of AC against the 8th amendment?\n* Is the lack of AC a crime deterrent?\n* Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime or a place to rehabilitate, or both?\n	>>Some at least 13 states (some states have no data on this): Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisianna, Mississippi, Missouri, N. Carolina, S. Caroline, Texa, Virginia lack AC.\n	\n	There’s some seriously hot states on that list. There’s evidence that hotter temperatures lead to violent crime. So having a hot, angry populace with criminal tendencies seems like a terrible situation, for both the inmates and guards.\n	\n	As to why AC is different than heat, it’s not seen as essential to life in the same way. I never went to a school that had AC and have lived in homes without it. This is getting rarer, but at the time, I would have been hard pressed to be upset prisoners didn’t have AC when I was sweating my own rear end off. It can be expensive to retrofit buildings for it, and spending money on criminals is not popular.\n		>Thanks for your life experiences, I was also very similar to you growing up, it's would be different for a person with high blood pressure, asthma, or diabetes they would be vulnerable to high temperatures. \n		\n		Being cool on an 85-degree day or staying indoors vs a high humidity 105 and above day are too very separate conditions and AC in many contexts feels luxurious but when you are a ward of the state and they can't cancel school for excessive heat or you can't go to the refriedge to crack open a cold drink to cool yourself off experiences can differ especially on days of excessive heat warnings.\n		\n		Excessive heat is my main concern and creating liveable connections for all inmates. I feel our society should treat our lower class with some humanity as well. That was what I tried and believed failed to highlight.\n	>I think focusing on AC while not considering other measures to control temperature and ensure people don't overheat is flawed. I used to be a welder and the Texas summers could be brutal sometimes. But being indoors, out of direct sunlight with adequate airflow made for a pretty easy day. Even when I was in full leathers. Now do these same prisons have adequate airflow? Do they make water available in sufficient quantities? Now if they don't have AC, don't have adequate airflow, and don't make water available in sufficient quantities then that is a violation of the 8th amendment. AC is not required to satisfy the 8th amendment.\n		>At a certain temperature those other means of cooling don't work for instance the CDC doesn't recommend water misters above a heat index of 105. So what about those conditions?\n			>When the heat index is 105 outside, go inside. If they have sufficient airflow and access to water then that should be fine.\n				>There are conditions that will be at a higher risk or death because of heat, because 10 people died I would say that is not adequate advice for all inmates. Would you agree?\n					>Certainly, and inmates with medical conditions that make them prone to heat related issues should probably be moved to facilities that can accommodate those conditions. That is probably a fairly small number of people though.\n						>I don't know what size that at risk population is based on the data provided.\n							>That seems like a requirement to really make a judgement here. Without that data, the question is should AC be a requirement under the 8th amendment for all of the prison population? In my opinion, that answer is no because it is pretty easy to stay cool for individuals that don't have medical conditions that are exacerbated by high temperatures when they are indoors with access to water and adequate airflow.\n	>> Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime\n	\n	Prison under any conditions acts as a deterrent around [1.24% of the time](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/34351/1/557359392.pdf). If the cruelty of prison is designed as a deterrent, it's doomed to fail. If we proposed other policies similar to prison that would have a 1.24% reduction in their targeted goal, we'd (rightfully) disregard them.\n	\n	Oh, and in the US, [prison has 'on balance, no rehabilitative or deterrent effects after release.'](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0604-8)\n	\n	On the rehabilitation side, what we do [isn't effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762476/?_escaped_fragment_=po=96.1538). The mere teaching of 'life skills' doesn't (per the prior study) show any capacity for rehabilitation. In fact [our prisons have recidivism up to 20% higher than some of our peer countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743246/).\n	\n	So to get back to your question,\n	\n	> Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime or a place to rehabilitate, or both?\n	\n	It doesn't seem prison *can* have deterrent effects, so we should focus on solving why people commit crime to begin with and combine it with rehabilitation.\n		>Prison's primary benefit is incapacitation, not deterrence or rehabilitation.  Someone in a cell can't commit crimes against the broader public.  \n		\n		So even if we assume that prison is only 1% effective at deterring crimes in advance, it is nearly 100% effective at either (a) stopping crimes or (b) isolating the crimes to the inside of a prison while the criminal is still in jail.\n		>Well, prison is very effective at providing incredibly cheap labor.\n	>The prison system SHOULD BE about rehabilitation, as it claims, but the corporations running them would go out of business if that were true.  \n	\n	Also:  I doubt a lack of AC is a functional deterrent.  I can see criminals gathered, discussing criminal activities, when one says, 'I can handle being in a cage, I can handle getting raped, I can handle people trying to kill me...wait, they don't have AC in prison?  Ok, I'm out.'\n		>The primary purpose of the prison system is incapacitation, not rehabilitation.  We put people in jail so they can't commit more crimes out in society, not because jail is going to fix them.  \n		\n		If the goal was to 'cure' someone's propensity to commit crimes, jail would be a terrible place to do it.\n",1623845762.0,2,hetero,no
ModeratePolitics,t3_o13gwa,h1yleyh,">Willis Carrier was granted the patent for his Apparatus for Treating Air, the first modern air conditioner, on January 2, 1906. \n\nThe ratification of the Bill of Rights was completed on December 15, 1791.\n\nWas the entire US in violation of the Eighth Amendment for 114 years and 18 days? \n\nI'm being snarky here, but my underlying point is that just because circumstances change, that doesn't mean that the laws do. If people think there's a right to climate control, pass another amendment. But don't just say that it's so.\n	>Law has historically changed based on technology. Abortion rights are one of the major hot-button issues right now that is centered around the viability of a child. Something that is purely driven by technology.\n		>But there's a good way and a bad way to do that. Good way is when legislators first allow the technology to proliferate to see how people use it, then they pass laws to deal with it. The bad way is to just force the tech under existing laws as the article is proposing. \n		\n		Yes, air conditioning has proliferated, but people treat it differently. A lot of people in their homes are very reluctant to use it regularly because of the electricity costs and because they prefer fresh air to  conditioned air. Businesses often use it as an attractor for customers. When we're talking about people in prison, maybe it can be a privilege for the prisoners who work more and follow the rules. But I think that pushing it to the level of a right is premature. If someday solar energy infrastructure is so widespread that electricity costs go down to $4 a month, maybe we can talk.\n			>Would you say at any point heat doesn't become a human right. Some extreme examples would be 110 heat index and someone with high blood pressure?\n				>That's where the question actually lies, doesn't it? If A/C isn't provided because of cost that is one thing, but if it's not provided in attempts to *harm* the prisoner that's probably where it potentially runs into an 8th amendment issue.\n				\n				If the judge who provided sentencing to the prisoner didn't outline or bare minimum expect that heat exhaustion would be used as punishment I think the prison could be running afoul.\n					>Well the 8th amendment is vague on purpose because you can't enumerate all the ways that it could be used correct? Can it be side steps by a cost argument? \n					\n					Shouldn't the government provide the basic needs to creat a liveable (not comfortable) environment while under their care.\n						>I only think cost could be used to sidestep it because it wouldn't be a *punishment* to the prisoner at that point, but instead would be an externality to the original punishment.\n						\n						That being said, I think there's considerable evidence that the lack of AC is used as a punishment in of itself. I personally don't see it any different than if the prison established a new policy of whipping the prisoners at 5pm every day, it's just a different form of extrajudicial punishment.\n							>I think our opinions on what the prison system should be differ wildly. But I appreciate you taking the time to explore this deeper with me so I can understand your point of view.\n					>> If A/C isn't provided because of cost that is one thing, but if it's not provided in attempts to harm the prisoner that's probably where it potentially runs into an 8th amendment issue.\n					\n					Even if the second reason is the underlying reason, it's easy to always claim that cost is the reason. A/C will always be more expensive than no A/C (unless medical costs skyrocket or the prison has to defend expensive lawsuits).\n						>Probably depends on the jury if we're going to be realistic here. There is tons of senators, representatives, and even wardens that outwardly exclaim that they don't *want* prisoners to have AC even when cost isn't considered.\n						\n						I doubt this could ever play out in courts with that being said, so many procedural issues connected to suing for this.\n				>[removed]\n					>I understand heating has been around for a long time I don't believe that's in question here.\n						>[removed]\n							>I didn't bring it up in this thread but I did bring it up in my original starter comments is that what you were referring to? \n							\n							In the story say at least 10 prisoners died because of heat should that not be a concern as well?

I didn't make myself clear, I will correct that to help other out. Thanks\n			>\>Yes, air conditioning has proliferated, but people treat it differently. A lot of people in their homes are very reluctant to use it regularly because of the electricity costs and because they prefer fresh air to conditioned air.\n			\n			When it comes to heat this is indeed a right in a more traditional sense; a lot of states and municipalities have specific [disconnection notice](https://ncler.acl.gov/Files/Protecting-Older-Adults-from-Utility-Disconnection.aspx) laws for seniors w.r.t. heating. I don't see why cooling would be that different.\n			\n			And if we already acknowledge that it's less luxury and more fundamental for surviving or thriving in an environment, I don't see it as that much of a stretch to think it's something prisoners should have.\n			\n			\>because of the electricity costs\n			\n			I don't think there's many people who would say 'Yeah it's totally fair and great that some people can't afford air conditioning'. People make that argument for, like, iPhones and other 'millenial panic' luxuries, but AC has been around long enough, like you said, to thoroughly proliferate.\n				>I'll say that it's fair and great. In my opinion no one is entitled to anything. Not food, not clean water, nothing that a caveman wouldn't be entitled to. Everything else you earn. Or ask for. We can make it easier to earn, and more likely to say yes if you ask for it, but I think that it's more important to have a universal and perpetual principle of law than to have it creep based on technological advancement.\n					>\>In my opinion no one is entitled to anything.\n					\n					Depending on what you mean by entitled, I agree! I think that natural law arguments are appeals to the supernatural personally.\n					\n					\>Everything else you earn.\n					\n					'Earn' is a normative judgment that is largely based on opinion or personal morality.\n					\n					At the end of the day, if providing air conditioning to both the impoverished and prisoners produces better outcomes, then we should do it, IMO. I don't think that universal perpetual principles of law are very healthy for a society to have. Stability is great, but neither the universe nor human technological circumstance cares much for it, and it seems foolish to pretend otherwise.\n	>The Supreme Court has repeatedly, going up to Gorsuch in [Bucklew, 2019](https://harvardlawreview.org/2019/11/bucklew-v-precythe/) defined “unusual” in cruel and unusual to mean “long disused” or not customary. The court doesn’t consider if a punishment would be unusual to someone in 1791 — nor to someone in 1689, as the phrase “cruel and unusual” is just taken from the English Bill of Rights. \n	\n	In [Trop v. Dulles](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1956/70), the court ruled that the term unusual tied the eighth amendment to \n	\n	> evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\n	\n	Even Scalia, in [Harmelin v. Michigan](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/957/#tab-opinion-1958878) interpreted “unusual” to mean not “in common use” meaning common use today, not 1719.\n	\n	The current court finds that the death penalty to not be unusual, because it’s been a traditional punishment in common use going up to the present. However, by this standard, they might find lack of air conditioning to be unusual — it is unusual in the present day for government buildings to lack air conditioning.\n	>That’s like arguing that the First Amendment only applies to ye olde printing press and people shouting in the town square.\n	>When you're violating [international law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/teas-prisons-international-human-rights-standard-violations) you're doing something wrong.\n		>When some third-world country violates international law, they're doing something wrong.

The consequences fall entirely on the individual's shoulders.  What am I missing here? Why are vaccinated people still bothering to wear masks, I might add? People criticize other groups for being anti-science, then proceed to act anti-scientifically.\n	>> What am I missing here? Why are vaccinated people still bothering to wear masks, I might add?\n	\n	There are two reasons that, when taken into consideration, explain why.\n	\n	The vaccine is very effective, but not 100% effective. There are still instances of vaccinated people contracting COVID, though in all those cases the symptoms are mild and there have been no cases of a vaccinated person requiring hospitalization as a result.\n	\n	The point of masks is not to prevent the wearer from contracting COVID, but to prevent the wearer from spreading COVID. I'm not sure where the myth that the primary purpose of masks is to protect yourself came from but it's certainly a damaging myth.\n	\n	So because a vaccinated person can still carry COVID, and the primary purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent the wearer (in this scenario a vaccinated wearer) from spreading COVID, there's still a good reason for a vaccinated person to wear a mask.\n	\n	Personally, anecdotally, mask mandates in my area have been lifted.

Ask_Politics,t3_o06zmz,h1unmr3,">These ideologies don't have a firm, objective meaning to separate them all. Some folks may have personal daylight between these three or four things, but if you ask someone else, the distinctions may be different or unimportant or what have you. You have to remember, politics is not a closed system--people don't only use words once they've accepted a fixed definition ahead of time. Put another way, Reagan, Bush 2, and Trump all talked about conservatives and what they want. And all three had vastly different political platforms that to them meant 'conservative.' That's because these are organic terms that change their meaning over time as the electorate adjusts and changes, and when you try and overdefine various ideologies in an attempt to make things more clear, often it only makes things murkier.\n\nThat's why you've had people define the same concept in two opposite ways before.

Ask_Politics,t3_nyc7ww,h1qx3uf,">So when you say 'immigration camps' what do you mean? The detention centers, or the temporary shelters that unaccompanied minors are being held at, or both, or something else? That could refer to different things, and it helps to be specific.\n\nRegardless of what the answer is--blaming either party for border conditions doesn't make a ton of sense. The bad conditions at detention centers have persisted through many different presidents, and neither party has been able to get us to a reasonable solution. Both parties are responsible for what things currently look like.\n\nTo respond to some of your friend's specific claims: \n\nThe problem is definitely not 'Democrats cutting the immigration budget': [Democrats didn't change overall funding of DHS when they took over, and they increased funding for facilities for children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/biden-border-wall-immigration-budget/2021/05/28/18836084-bff0-11eb-9bae-5a86187646fe_story.html) They're considering cutting funding for detention centers and border patrol in the future, but haven't done it yet.\n\n>He also says the camps can't just let the families go without DNA tests because there isn't a guarantee they aren't human traffickers\n\n[There was a DNA testing program piloted under Trump.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/26/ken-cuccinelli/trump-administration-using-dna-tests-crack-down-fa/) Republicans are trying to make it required, but it currently is not.\n	>I believe he was referring to the camps that were created under Obamas term and the ones currently being scrutinized for the poor conditions. \n	\n	And huh. Then what would he be referring to when he says they cut the budget?\n		>Detention centers at the border existed long before Obama. Obama did build more centers in response to a surge in 2014--most of them *better* than the pre-existing centers. That doesn't mean they were great, though. But they were cleaner, with more room, and air conditioning, which many of the older holding areas don't have.\n		\n		I'm guessing your friends was referencing the 'Obama built the cages' argument, which [this article explains a bit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/kids-in-cages-debate-trump-obama/2020/10/23/8ff96f3c-1532-11eb-82af-864652063d61_story.html). Some of Obama's new detention centers used fencing to separate different demographic groups of people (young men from families, etc.). This had been standard practice for a long time, but in the past they hadn't used fencing to do it. (They'd be kept in separate centers or separate rooms, things like that.) When Trump came into office, he decided to start criminally prosecuting families that had illegally crossed the border. This law had already existed, but previous administrations hadn't applied it to families. This left children alone in the detention centers without their parents, behind the fences that had previously separated different groups, which spawned a thousand news stories.\n		\n		Hopefully this helps illustrate that this isn't just the work on one administration, but of a lot of cumulative decisions by many administrations. The U.S.'s first modern detention center started construction under Carter and was opened under Reagan--although of course American detention centers date back to Ellis Island!--so it's been more than forty years of making the problem worse.\n			>Interesting. Thanks for the info. So I guess it's more of a cumulative problem issue. But what I am wondering is where did the budget statement my friend was referring to come from?\n",1623688927.0,2,hetero,no
Ask_Politics,t3_nx7lcn,h1fxem4,">A quick note about cause and effect in situations like this given your note about the seeming incongruity of 1973 and Reagan. First of all correlation doesn't imply causation. It's very possible that the graph first started to really pick up in 1973 because of natural, reasonable market forces: technology has almost always made folks more productive, or it's possible there's was a bit of a shift in how businesses approached certain things which showed a noticeable increase in productivity, or in the natural curve here we would see some ups and downs and we just happened to have an up right then. The point is, lots of these concepts are very complex and multicausal, especially when we're talking about something as multifaceted as the American economy. It's tempting to look for the 'one thing' that perfectly explains a graph, but the reality is that quite often it's lots of things contributing and even your causal arguments will be somewhat incomplete. But let's not forget: a partial cause is still a cause, and something doesn't have to explain something 100% for it to be a contributing factor.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that sometimes the effect is delayed. So for example, Reagan dissolved the airline unions in 1981. This probably wasn't that big a deal in 1981. For one thing, less union dues put an immediate shot in the arm of workers that replaced those fired in 81. On top of that, a sudden enormous shortage of labor, combined with relatively expensive and time consuming training, combined with the absolute necessity of filling positions quickly, could have created a rather labor-friendly work condition until staffing levels rose and quality of hire started to level out. But once that system got back to a standard baseline...then all of a sudden workers have a lot less protections and wage growth stalls. So even if we didn't see an issue start to develop in this field for another half decade, that doesn't mean it wasn't at its core an issue with Reaganite policies.\n",1623441929.0,3,homo,no
Ask_Politics,t3_nutljv,h12st26,">So, the government doesn't have any direct control over your wages aside from the minimum wage. Companies decide how much to pay you as an employee. \n\nWhile the government technically has a lot of money and it is overly spent on defense, there are still things that require more money than they get now( infrastructure, education, VA, medicare, etc)  and historically saying you want to cut the military budget comes off as 'not supporting the troops'  and losses you votes. Also, in places where they manufacturer or cater to the military can also take a hit.\n\nWhich brings us to taxes. Taxes are as much as civic duty as anything else. It's the primary way the gov gets money. The primary function of the IRS is to collect those taxes( which are set by Congress). Failure to collect that money, even in small quantities can have terrible affects on our debts and deficits. \n\nRich people frequently hire tax lawyers to find loopholes to avoid paying higher taxes. So, while the tax rate might look high, most people don't pay anything near it. While not illegal, it can be harmful to the nation long term.\n\nMoreover, because they have lawyers they are harder to audit, so the IRS just goes for poorer people, because it's cheaper.\n\nSome say, well even if it's less than it's supposed to be, they pay more than the average person, which why technically true goes against the spirit of things.We're supposed to invest in our country. Warren Buffett famously paid less in taxes than his Secretary. \n\nRaising the minimum wage is a good idea and we should do it, but the people affected by it need all that money, since the cost of living has risen drastically.\n",1623187500.0,3,homo,no
