moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h15poei,">I honestly don't have an issue with this.  We often look for additional ways to punish prisoners and write it off as though they deserve whatever bad treatment they receive.  This just results in worse prison conditions and higher rates of recidivism.  The vast majority of people in prison are not abusing this system, they are using it to just get by and get things most people would consider as essentials.  \n\nThe article mentions 20 prisoners out of 129,000 that have large amounts.  That's about .015 percent, no i don't think this is a large or pressing issue.\n\nThe Justice department and BOP have different goals, I'm glad that the BOP is focused on their goal in this situation and not that of the Justice Dept. because that's how it should be.\n	>I see an issue in edge cases and feel a more moderate approach might be in order such as:\n	\n	* Cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n	* allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders. \n	* Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n	\n	I'm not worried about them but feel if it can be abused maybe we should have a bit more restrictions on them without an additional burden on the prisoner.\n		>It sounds more like there are a few exceptional cases and trying to find a solution for those few cases by painting it as a larger issue than it is.  Court orders already exist and are a valid way to enforce the judgements against prisoners.\n		\n		>cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n		\n		If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n		\n		>allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders.\n		\n		Sound like justifying violating the 4th amendment because the person is in prison.  They are already greatly limited in exercising their rights, but that doesn't excuse further abuses without a valid need when they are able to obtain a court order if needed.\n		\n		>Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n		\n		There's already limits on how much they can spend from these accounts.  Why more restrictions?  What is the problem that we are trying to solve here?\n			>Prisoners get shaken down and have their mail read. Why is looking at their financial activity less intrusive than throwing their mattress on the floor?\n				>Their cells are subject to inspection and searches due to the fact contraband could be physically concealed there.  Mail is inspected to check against smuggling contraband.  \n				\n				These are both safety issues to the prison and of the prisoners, how does their financial activity relate to physical safety?\n			>>If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n			\n			Well, if the accounts are shielded from things like child support or alimony orders, they could be an effective way to hide money and keep it from people legally entitled to it.\n				>Court orders are exist for this and are an effective tool.\n					>>	Federal prison inmates are keeping large sums of money — in some cases more than $100,000 each — in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders for things like child support, alimony or other debts, and not subject to the same scrutiny as accounts owned by non-incarcerated citizens, according to court documents and interviews.\n					\n					Literally the first paragraph of the article.\n",1623249865.0,2,hetero,no
moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h15fsuz,">This is like a couple dozen dollars per prisoner on average right?\n\nFeels like a lot of money but there's also a lot of people in prison in the USA.\n	>No solid data is known about the average. Here is relevant information based on the story.\n	\n	>Within the Federal Bureau of Prisons system, which houses roughly 129,000 inmates in facilities throughout the United States, there are more than 20 inmate accounts holding more than $100,000 each for a total exceeding $3 million, a person familiar with the program told The Washington Post.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Sometimes the sources are known, such as inmates cashing out their 401(k) retirement accounts or receiving payments from insurance policies. In other cases, it is less clear how the prisoner has amassed such funds. \n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>According to the individual familiar with the program, one of the biggest account holders is a disgraced former doctor with more than $250,000, while a former member of the military serving a life sentence for murder has more than $200,000.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Most prisoner accounts have only small sums of money.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Inmates can buy snacks and other goods in a prison’s commissary, but may not spend more than $360 a month there. Prisoners can also pay to make a limited number of phone calls or send a limited number of emails, though some of the restrictions have been eased during the coronavirus pandemic. And prisoners can send up to $100 a day to other people or have the government issue U.S. Treasury checks for any amount from their prison accounts.\n",1623245561.0,2,hetero,no
moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h159h8b,">Federal prison inmates do have a unique loophole. They can keep money in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders (child support, alimony, debts).\n\nThese accounts are not subject to criminal or regulatory scrutiny that could flag suspicious activity report because the agency is not considered a financial institution and does not run its bank transactions through a treasury department screening program.\n\nThe department of corrections says they have an [Inmate Financial Responsibility Program](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/BOP/e0023/intro.htm) that cannot force inmates to comply with state court orders but will incentivize them to do through privileges. The loophole in the Bureau of Prisons' policy is that they only accept federal court orders and not states.\n\nIn some cases, inmates were released from prison while the Justice Department was still trying to collect money. The Bureau of Prisons gave them debit cards with their account balances on them. The marshals had to track down the men to get their government-issued bank cards.\n\nA Tennessee bank robber asked a federal judge to order the $16,000 he owed in restitution to be taken from his prison account. A Bureau of Prisons staffer urged him not to pay the entire sum -- but rather to pay on a schedule of $100 a month (he would have paid off half of what was owed when he served his time)\n\nCongress has enacted a law that requires inmates to pay what they owe, but the Bureau of Prisons doesn't enforce that without specific court orders.\n\n*What is your thought about this type of arrangement?*\n\nIf you're **against it,** Why shouldn't inmates have money that they can spend for commentary, phone calls, etc. that would be protected from court orders?\n\nIf you're **for it**, Could a system like this be abused or even used as a bribery system for wealthy inmates?\n\n**On the fence**, what type of reform should we apply to this system?\n	>This seems kinda like a non-issue if the wealthiest prisoners (around 20) only have about 100K in their account. The issue with not protecting the little money they do have is in most prisons, prisoners are required to pay for a lot of their goods. If the state was allowed to zero out their accounts then they’d have no recourse because they wouldn’t be able to afford an attorney and they’d have no money to buy the goods they need.\n		>We agree that zeroing out their account is not something that should be done. That said, making this limitless system limited might allow a person to put money into a protected account while having excess money allow that be collectible. \n		\n		Doing away with excessive finds would be something I would be for but allowing sheltered bank accounts sounds like it could be ripe for abuse as well if you have enough money.\n			>Ripe for abuse is a non-concern when there are so many existing financial loopholes and non-compliance issues in use by people shielding much more than these 20 people's three million dollars.\n			\n			If we can use this as an excuse to get people with a hard-on for punitive justice on board to implement broad financial and tax reform in a way where actual loop holes and abuses are addressed, then I'm fine with this as rhetoric.\n			\n			Pretending it's a relevant existing issue that demands attention on its own is pretty silly though,  given those numbers.\n	>I think, as a side comment, there’s an argument for shielding prisoners from financial collections while they’re in custody, and sometime after. \n	\n	If the goal is rehabilitation, that cannot occur if someone is broke when they get out. Desperation is a motivation for some, but not all crimes - and while it’s no excuse, I would think that the social benefits of lower recidivism can outweigh the costs. \n	\n	I think of it similar to how collecting back rent from tenants is inherently difficult - the alternative is forcing people into homelessness, which has significantly higher societal costs.\n	>The article specifically references a Megan Bailey, in prison in Missouri on methamphetamine charges.\n	\n	I searches Missouri's court records, and found only Marijuana charges (and traffic violations) under that name. However, per the article:\n	\n	> Megan Bailey, a convicted methamphetamine dealer in Missouri, who was ordered to pay $250,000 as part of a 17-year prison sentence she received in 2019.\n	\n	It's possible Bailey was a drug 'kingpin', peddling large quantities and making large sums in the process. If that were the case, I'd expect to see at least local news articles. None such articles exist.\n	\n	What this tells me is this is *probably* (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure. Dealers typically make [~24,000 per year](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-07-11-9002260581-story.html) so the fine at least feels excessive.\n	\n	In situations like that one, allowing the state to take what little money she does have all but guarantees recidivism.\n	\n	So, even though the system could be (and most certainly is being) abused, until we take efforts to clean up the existing sentencing and fines structures, I have a hard time being angry about it.\n		>Be cautious using the lack of data as proof of anything other than you cannot find the data. I believe federal records are via PACER and not state websites as we are talking about a federal crime. (I'm not for sure.. if a Redditor with more info can reply to this comment that would be great)\n		\n		According to a website, I will not name (as it has her inmate number). Megan Bailey was incarcerated for Conspiracy to distribute Meth, Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime.\n		\n		While you're describing a separate problem (excessive fines) something we both agree and it is tangibly related. But the lack of regulation could have issues beyond excessive finds.  It also might be an invitation to use the money to bribe guards given the lack of safeguards on the money.\n			>250k is an absurd fine for distributing meth and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime.\n			\n			What did locking up Megan Bailey accomplish? There's still meth on the streets, it's extremely easy to get and very cheap. We've been locking up drug dealers under brutally harsh sentences for decades now and none of this has changed. \n			\n			The drug war is pointless cruelty.\n		>>What this tells me is this is probably (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure.\n		\n		What tells me this is probably *not* a relatively small crime is twofold:\n		\n		a) It's a federal incarceration and feds don't give a shit about low level street dealers that make minimum wage.\n		\n		b) The length of the sentence.  Federal sentencing is pretty straight forward - crimes are assigned base levels and there are modifiers that can add or subtract levels. Add up all the levels for all the crimes and you get a sentencing range.\n		\n		Receiving a 17 year sentence puts her between [levels 30 and 35](https://guidelines.ussc.gov/chapters/5/parts/A/sections) on the sentencing table depending on criminal history and other variables. To put that in perspective, there are only 43 levels total and the crime of trafficking methamphetamine of 12-30 **pounds** is a [level 34.](https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2018-guidelines-manual/2018-chapter-2-d)\n		\n		It probably wasn't just that and there were additional crimes like firearm possession.  But it's just not the case that this was your friendly dealer that lives down the hall at your dorm.\n			>[Apparently the median base level offense is a 32](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Methamphetamine_FY16.pdf) - which implies this person was at or near the median, plus the known possession of a firearm (+2). [Based on this](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-ut/legacy/2013/06/03/fedfacts%20for%20utah_web.pdf) the fine could be related to:\n			\n			> Unlawful for any person to place an advertisement in any newspaper,\n			magazine, handbill **or other publications** seeking or offering to illegally\n			receive, buy, or distribute any Schedule I controlled substance.\n			\n			Which carries a $250,000 fine. If I use an at-home printer to make an advert, and staple it to an electric pole - $250,000 fine.\n			\n			Hell, a business card could mean a $250,000 fine.\n				>>The median base offense level in these cases was 32. This corresponds to a quantity of drugs between 3.3 and 11.0 pounds of methamphetamine.\n				\n				Again, not a small crime.\n				\n				I find it pretty unlikely though that a drug trafficker at the level of moving pounds of meth was printing out advertisements at Office Depot and stapling them to telephone poles around the neighborhood.\n				\n				The reality is we have no idea why the fine was imposed, but the maximum fine for methamphetamine trafficking *by itself* is [$10 million.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30722.pdf)..  so Occam's Razor suggests it could simply have been for that.\n					>Per [this source](https://theconversation.com/most-us-drug-arrests-involve-a-gram-or-less-118440) using data from UC Davis Law Review, ~25% have more than 5 grams.\n					\n					These two aren't reconcilable. It cannot be the case that the median is < 5 grams and carries the penalty of ~7 lbs *unless* the median is skewed by non-drug-mass related characteristics.\n					\n					What those are is hard to tell, but the assertion that she was carrying 3.3 to 11 *pounds* doesn't comport with the statistics we have.\n						>The error you’re making is conflating federal drug prosecutions with all state and local drug prosecutions.\n",1623242365.0,2,hetero,no
moderatepolitics,t3_nvgd2h,h13bl5i,">What is it with these blue states in New England, electing moderate red governors? IIRC, there was a post here recently about the Republican governor of Vermont. That’s my biggest unanswered question in this article.\n\nIn theory, it has the potential to prevent the state GOP from drifting too far to the right. Living in a red state where the state party often threatens to tar and feather the governor of its own party for not being Trumpy enough, I don’t know that it will work that way.\n	>Part of it has to do with open primaries. Something like 70% of massachusetts voters are registered as independent. Often people will vote for the candidate that they see as less bad of the opposition so it encourages more moderate candidates at the state level. Also there isn't the massive ideological divide in Massachusetts that there is in the rest of the country. Fiscally moderate and socially liberal describes a lot of people here. Also the fact that the largest religion group in mass Catholics tend to vote Democrat eats away at the support for a more socially conservative candidate. The state GOP as an organization might be behind Trump but there are enough moderates and liberals here that nominating a candidate that openly espouses Trump's views would hand the election to even the most boring democratic candidate\n	>I think it's more the other direction. Democrats have the run of our legislature, so people like to vote for Republicans in the Governorship to keep them in check. We don't really care much about the state GOP here, they're kind of a joke. Lyons is nuts if he thinks going full Trump is going to help them though.\n		>I mean it’s unfair to characterize him as a moderate republican. He’s really a moderate Democrat with an R next to his name. This article almost reads like the onion. “The GOP should take advice from the rights most liked politician by leftists”.\n		>Not exactly. The MA Democratic is not exactly known for being progressive; a lot of progressives and leftists have called out the party for being a corrupt establishment party that's interested in self-preservation. One only needs to look at the dirty tricks employed against Alex Morse to see how corrupt the state party is. \n		\n		https://newrepublic.com/article/161406/charlie-baker-massachusetts-democratic-party-failure\n			>Oh yeah, part of the reason is that informed voters don't trust the party for unilateral rule. The progressive thing is just what I hear as a reason that people say they voted R for Gov. Much of our more progressive stuff has come out of referendums and pressure from the public.\n	>They elect Republican governors because they balance the worse impulses of the Supra-majority legislatures.\n	>Is it really that unique?  \n	\n	While often blue, places like California, Massachusetts, Baltimore, Vermont, and New York have had Republican governors in relatively recent history.\n		>These guys wouldn't even be Republicans in, like, North Carolina.\n		>Ah yes, the good old state of Baltimore\n	>You'll get a lot of the 'balance' theories in response to that, but this implies and intentionality that I don't agree is there. The bottom line is that most of these 'blue states' aren't actually blue.\n	\n	For example, with Massachusetts, you can see [here](https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/03/19/massachusetts-past-election-results) that the state is split about 2:1 Democrat vs Republican, but there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n	\n	So in an environment where 1 out of every 3 voters are Republican to begin with, it only takes a few other factors to tip an election. Those factors could be (note that I don't know if these are true, but they seem to match the data):\n	\n	* Republicans tend to be older and thus more of them vote.\n	* Conservative Democrats are often turned off by the candidates that Democrats in that state nominate.\n	* The state has had a string of Republican governors that were widely respected, endorsing each other on the way out.\n	* The Republican party has focused its support on that race\n	* As speculated elsewhere in this post, people could prefer someone as executive that balances out the super-majority of Democrats in other branches.\n	\n	If any two of these are true it could be enough to push the race over the edge, but if I had to guess, I'd be willing to bet that most of them are true.\n		>> there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n		\n		The smaller ones do, and not very many.  On your list, the most populous district that leans red is Billerica at something like 30th place, population-wise.  Next one is Westfield, another 10 places down.  You can expect the smallest towns to vote conservative, but not many people live there.\n	>It's the people. They have an identity crisis. Have you been to Boston? Everyone is staunchly liberal but ridiculously conservative. They will preach about the good of homeless shelters but make sure to block any attempts to build one within 10 miles of them. They will promote racial equality but then only hire white people. They actually worked for years to shut down the only gay nightclub in Boston until they finally did it.

Tbh these days he could easily pass for a more right wing Democrat.\n\nBut another thing that caught my eye was the increasingly Trumpification of state GOP organisations. They’re very intent about influencing the direction of the state GOPs even at the cost of losing power.\n	>Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts. As a resident of the state most people I talk to either like the guy or are ambivalent. There are definitely those who are open to fiscal conservatives amongst the younger generation as balancing the budget is a generally popular proposal. However anyone more socially to the right wouldn't have a path to state office. There does seem to be this almost libertarian bent around here no matter which side of the aisle you are on with a distrust of the power of the federal government in general. This state will elect whoever promises to pass a balanced budget and changes the status quo the least.\n		>> Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts.\n		\n		The article says that Mass. has been electing Republicans governors regularly for the last sixty years\n			>That's fair I should be probably said in this current political climate. I don't think anyone that is riding the current wave of trump populism would not have a shot in this state for instance. The man in your tag Ike would still be able to win in Massachusetts for example. But it requires a very moderate republican by today's standards to carry the state. Any hint of right of center social views generally loses you the election before it starts. Republicans win here by staying away from social issues entirely and promising to balance the budget and promote the states rights over the federal government. All of them have been generally popular here too with the exception of Romney at the end when he decided to spend the 2nd half of his term campaigning for president and handing the Democrats the seat on beacon hill.\n			>West Virginia had been electing Democratic governors regularly for the last several decades too but that doesn't mean Democrats really stood a good shot in 2020 or will in 2024.

Fact: more people AND businesses leave California each year due to overregulation, high taxes, high cost of living, superficial Hollywood newcomers, overcrowding, my God, there must be much more! I’m sorry it wasn’t contained in California, the disease has spread certainly and regrettably to Washington state, Oregon and Colorado. It has spread to most other states as well. It was clearly done - it seems like certain companies that attract a certain type of people decided to set up camp in the most densely populated cities thus infecting most large cities. The infection also emanates from schools of all grades through university. The talk was BIG: The media was bought, all 6 major companies organized through ProPublica to coordinate local, regional and national news sources. Corporate was bought to push the agenda through policy in ads, social media, employees. Polls were bought to see the real results and relay false results.\n	\n	The talk was so BIG it fooled the average sheep. \n	\n	\n	We later learned that whole branches of government AND government agencies had failed to protect our checks and balances as hours and hours of testimony and physical hard evidence of voting and election fraud were collected and made public. The media with 95% control of all media withheld the information. Luckily some trickled through.\n	\n	Biden campaigned the least of any political candidate in the history of the United States. Pulled the least number of supporters to rallies (and video views for covid paranoids). The rap sheet for the crime, the motive, lack of sincerity and admission of guilt on video uttered by his own mouth + Time Magazine’s own admission show that the guy cheated and did not win lawfully. The Supreme Court was supposed to hear the court cases even if to still deny the doubt of election integrity. Were they bribed? threatened? Or worse? Was it to prevent a civil war? Shut the BLM and Antifa up? To protect the citizens? Are lives more important? What did the veterans of all prior wars die for then? To allow socialism, tyranny, communism? To allow hundreds if not thousands kill themselves with this endless present? Alcohol, suicide, extreme poverty, depression, isolation. Not allowed to socialize? Congregate for religion? Kids developing social anxiety? and not learning in school anymore? Learning Marxism? Learning to hate their country? That they are racist before they even know what that is?\n	\n	Truth is all we got. We have been fighting the communist war since March 2020. Biological warfare resulting in a healthcare state. The medical field is plagued by parties holding a stake in the money made. Workers are deluding themselves about how it really is - they went through the schooling and depend on their job to live. Others are making a pretty penny off incentives to diagnose covid positive. Insurance billing, supplies, pharma, hospitals, doctors. How much did you pay for a rapid test before your flight to Boston where they say you must pass the test before your flight - some paid $400!!!! BTW - no one checks for it!!!! Yes, no one asked for it! Gotcha!!! And only 1 WHOLE YEAR later, they just decided they got too many false positives and turned the PCR thermocycler cycles down. Magically! The number of cases are down! BTW we got reports early on that they constantly had false positives. Yes, too many bad apples were bought and paid for, killed or somehow silenced to not speak the truth.\n	\n	The average sheep bought the whole BS To cheat the election using all means used in the past (exemplified and perfected in California and New York) and using as many mail in ballots as physically needed. The people today had more information than at anytime in the past. Many played stupid and all suffered the consequences. This is a lesson for Libertarians. You can’t just let the government run itself and expect it to not get out of control at some point. It’s gone WAY WAY haywire!\n	\n	I’m sorry my friend!

In AZ, they timed the legislation to end when the current Dem SoS's term is over; it's blatant.\n			\n			Beyond that, the gerrymandering in the pipeline will likely give the House to GOP, and it's pretty clear that they won't certify the next President unless they are a Republican.\n			\n			The suppression is bad, but the groundwork being laid for outright fuckery combined with an apparently clear willingness to use it is what's scaring the shit out of us.\n				>Jamey, is that you?\n				>You're right.

Just last week, they over performed Biden in a race for Congress that the GOP would have loved to win. Last night, they overperformed Biden in a State House race in New Hampshire - despite a bunch if outside spending.

conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h15aqjp,">I have followed CJ for awhile now. He is an impressive, dare I say, kid.\n	>Not long enough, apparently.\n	\n	I’d let him finish growing up before celebrating him; he’s already been through full grift cycles. Became famous for alleging that Obama had blocked him on Twitter but it turned out he was lying. Was hired as Ted Cruz’ youth director out of that. Turned himself into a consultant and scammed a bunch of money out of other young Republicans that wanted a national voice like he had, doing virtually nothing to help them but taking their money anyway. When that came out, he was fired. Then he dropped out of Republican circles and went to work for Bernie Sanders as a youth person. Dunno what happened there, but now he’s back as a Republican activist. \n	\n	Kid’s young, so I’m not going to hold ancient behavior against him for forever, I just think he’s still young enough that his history warrants a bit of caution.\n		>Wow, I wasn't aware of that at all. That's crazy. How can you consider yourself a conservative and support Bernie Sanders? lmao. Kid is obviously a little confused and maybe is still trying to find his own identity.\n			>It’s easy if you have no principles and are just out for yourself.\n				>Or, if you are young and malleable and susceptible to any new idea that sounds like it's a good one at face value.\n					>Certainly but it seems like his goal is not the cause, but rather money and clout.\n						>That’s quite the assumption\n							>One assumption deserves another.\n					>Or you are a grifter….\n				>I think that qualifies him as solidly conservative.\n		>Yeah, I would be cautious with him. He's as fickle as the wind.\n		>That smile is pretty infectious. Must be crazy to have that much charisma.\n		>Do you remember why he renounced conservatism, and how old he was? That was 5 years, maybe a little more. He was 13 I think. At the time he was taking flak for being a black conservative, even only at 13. He was getting hit left and right with 'why are you standing up for the racist party.' type things. A popular 13 year old 'youtube star' in politics getting blasted because he is a conservative black kid on a liberal medium. Of course he questioned what he was doing!   \n		\n		\n		And let's be honest, what 13 year old, even in politics, doesn't find Bernie Sanders fascinating. The dude has great promises and makes it sound like he can usher in a prosperous future. Of course he was drawn to that. Did you ever think that maybe Bernie is the reason CJ ended back on the Republican side?\n		\n		So many teenagers who are conservatives are constantly surrounded by hostile politics. Think of all the liberals around them. School, media, video games, and friends. The fact that he dabbled in another ideology, let alone a super popular one at the time, is not unheard of at all. In the past 3 years, he has been a good voice for Republicans.  \n		\n		One more thing, he did indeed do everything you said, but I tell you what, all those things are very huge characteristics of a politician. Possibly a good one, but we will see. We all make mistakes, especially as kids. So far, his mistakes are very forgivable and can be chalked up to learning experiences. To my knowledge, he has not replicated any of the bad mistakes.\n			>I think flip-flopping and grifting makes a terrible politician. He has charisma and confident speaking skills, which make for smooth politicians, not necessarily good legislators.\n			\n			I specifically noted that I wouldn’t hold it against him forever and that I’m not saying he should be blackballed, just that an ounce of caution is warranted considering his history and that I think he should be given the grace of anonymity to finish growing up/figuring out what he actually believes. Money talks. He clearly knows that. It’s a lot tougher to be certain of his political convictions when he’s not been consistent through obscurity or difficulty.\n			\n			Maybe he will be consistently conservative the rest of his life. Only time will tell— and that’s all I’m saying. Don’t celebrate him yet. Be cautious. If he’s still consistent in five years, then I’ll be much more willing to count his young missteps as just that.\n	>He's way too grown to be called a kid...

The idea that “non-whites” don’t speak on issues is not true. It seems that the only time you want to hear their voice is when it’s convenient to your political beliefs.

Conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h155ab6,">Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does. It's one thing to say this theory is so extreme it can't be taught in K-12, which is focused on giving minors a basic education. It's another thing to advocate banning it on college campuses. College should be about the open exchange of ideas and rather than advocate banning it, Pearson should learn it and challenge it head on in debate.\n	>By this logic, universities should be teaching witchcraft and flat earth theory too.\n	\n	They don't teach those topics because they are obviously wrong, why would we make an exception to CRT?\n		>I think that this is an unfair comparison. No modern day politician believes in witchcraft, but many modern day politicians believe in Critical Race Theory. Even then, if we look at something like pure Communism via the 1850 manifesto, no one believes in that exact document anymore. Everyone who believes in Communist-esque ideology now is a neo-Marxist, neo-Leninist, or some pretty removed form from the original document. I bring this up to mention that people still teach classes on Marx's *Communist Manifesto* even though no one believes in that form of 'government' for lack of a better word.\n		\n		I think that it is fair to ban classes from teaching critical race theory in high schools, as it is a highly politicized topic, difficult to opt out of, very niche regarding much of history, and risks taking too much of a hardline 'this is the way that it happened' as opposed to just making it an idea that some people believe.\n		\n		I do not believe that it should be banned or even left out of from (optional) colleges curriculums however. In college, it is an opt in choice, and students' minds are far less malleable. Also, most people who take a course on critical race theory will be people who will be political scientists or history majors. Teaching highschool students as a whole is very different from teaching just history majors and political scientists, if they choose to listen.\n		\n		To summarize my feelings on the topic, I think that Critical Race Theory is a poor way to look at history, as it does not really allow for solutions. In spite of this, you have to remember when ideas are banned, you create unmoderated, underground groups of radicals. I would rather have the idea be taught at universities in the public eye where discourse can take place, than foster radical groups that promote unadulterated versions of their ideas.\n		>Some universities do teach witchcraft (history of it anyway) and discuss flat earth theory as a theory when discussing history.\n		\n		These were kind of bad examples to your point.  Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well, should be ban those?\n		\n		Banning the discussion of a subject or theory from academia just makes it taboo, and could even cause the inverse effect where more people seek it out considering it's now 'forbidden'.\n		\n		All theories should be up for discussion in post-secondary education.  It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			>Teaching *about* a theory is very different from teaching a theory as being correct.\n				>I agree, I didn't say I wanted CRT taught exactly the way it's being taught, I'm just saying outright banning the subject from even discussion at universities seems like a step too far.\n				\n				Again, banning something rarely gets rid of it, it just drives it underground.\n			>>It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			\n			Congratulations for contradicting your whole argument and making my argument for me.\n			\n			Do you honestly believe these CRT courses are looking at the topic in an objective, historical comparison? Have you seen any of the reading material or seen any speakers?\n			\n			Honestly, they have it set up brilliantly. They lecture you on how the entire premise of the country is flawed, and anything that goes against that narrative is used as evidence that the narrative exists.\n			\n			If you try to refute the goals of the founders using, idk their letters and articles from the time, then they just accuse you of defending the 'racist' system they founded.\n				>Except schools are teaching it as a serious established theory that you should consider believing yourself. The entire program is to convince you of its merits. Witchcraft classes don’t have that approach.\n			>> Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well\n			\n			Do they now ? Because most of the college people I've talked with apparently have little to no idea what any of those are.\n				>I can't speak for everyone but when I attended undergraduate my political science classes discussed the differences in ideology quite extensively as well as their similarities.\n				\n				Admittedly it's been about 16 years since I went to Undergrad, and my graduate degree is an MBA, so not much political science there.\n		>We don't need the government to ban the teaching of flat Earth or witchcraft.\n			>That's not really my point.\n			\n			Why aren't universities open to teaching those topics? Shouldn't they teach anything by your logic?\n			\n			Remember, universities are government sustained. You can easily make the argument when a university takes a position on something, they are backed by the government.\n				>Private universities aren’t public \n				\n				Colleges already essentially teach whatever they want including about those subjects\n				\n				It’s up to the faculty, administration, and students. Not the government. It’s academic freedom, something that we should take care not to infringe\n		>No, by that logic universities should be banned from teaching it, which was his point. Universities teach the bible too, which is just as wrong in many places.\n			>Universities teach the history of the bible and deconstruct the ideas behind it. Same thing with Islam.\n			\n			They don't convert the students to those religions in those courses like they do in CRT. In my experience, classes teaching about religion are more likely to promote atheism in the students than a more positive outlook on religion.\n				>Religious universities, which receive federal and state money, do teach it as truth. But you ignored his point, which is that the government shouldn't be involved in banning university curricula.\n		>Okay, I'm very much against CRT. But, I don't like the idea of seeing anything as 'obviously wrong' in an academic setting. Maybe it's my education background in STEM, but much of the innovation we make comes from things we once considered obviously wrong.   \n		\n		\n		There are pros and cons when information is free to be discussed.\n			>Then you've killed the entire purpose of higher education. \n			\n			If our universities, publicly funded by the way, start teaching 2+2=5 because we no longer believe in objective truth, than higher education is worthless.\n			\n			CRT is entirely based on numerous false premises. The idea that the nation's very foundation is racist, is false. The idea that we are nothing more than the average of our intersectional/post-modernist identity groups, is false. The idea that western society is the genesis for all evil in the world right now, is totally false. Honestly, Santa Claus is more believable than CRT.\n				>Don't spend a fucking paragraph explaining why something is bad that I've stated I don't endorse. It's pointless. And, no, not all universities are publicly funded.\n				\n				The ideas of Plank, Bohr, Shrodinger, Einstein, Oppenheimer, etc were all considered obviously wrong and based on incorrect presuppositions. When it turned out that the prevailing presuppositions were wrong. I'm not here defending CRT. I'm here defending the idea that the mainstream 'correct' think is not always right. And, using the 2+2=5 analogy brings a level of irony into this, as an adage to 1984. Freedom is the freedom to say 2+2=4. If that is granted, all else follows.\n				\n				'Right think' is being advocated on both sides and it's not just detrimental, it's downright authoritarian. The antidote to bad ideas isn't banning them. It's challenging them with good ideas. We used to believe this, at one point.\n	>So far I've seen laws, at least in the Oklahoma one, they don't really '' ban it'', they just forbid making it's teaching obligatory. They can still teach this kind of garbage, but they can't force you to take the class, nor they can make your grades depend on it.\n	>Just to gauge where your lines would be; do you feel that should apply to tax-funded public schools, or only privately funded ones? Do you also advocate for the teaching of sexism in universities? Or just racism? Because CRT literally advocates for (actually) institutionalized racism. \n	\n	I totally get your point! That the idea of 'cancelling' ideas we don't like makes us not much better than the unhinged lefties! Consider though, that the idea of suppressing abhorrent and dangerous world views isn't new. We 'cancelled' tf outta Hitler for using CRT to 'other' the Jews. Do we not generally try to eliminate, or *cancel* racism? How would opposing CRT be any different than opposing any *other* form of racism? I'm just trying to figure out if you support the idea of teaching racism in general, or if this one specific form just feels different to you somehow. \n	\n	As easy as the idea of standing idly by allowing evil to thrive sounds, sometimes in life we've gotta stand up for our principles. Assuming we have any. Sometimes good *has* to cancel evil, or we condemn entire future generations to the consequence of our complacency. It's not really the same as trying to ruin someones career and life because they uttered some word 20 years ago that we don't like.\n		>Frankly, I would do away with government education in the first place. There should be a separation of education and state. \n		\n		Having said that, the government did not ban National Socialist ideology. In fact, many progressives thought fascism was great in the 1920's and 1930's. Communists opposed the fascists, until the Hitler-Stalin pact and then fascism was fine. Until the war anyway. After National Socialism had been defeated and the horrors of death camps discovered the government didn't need to ban Nazism or eugenics, these doctrines were naturally abandoned. \n		\n		I would much rather conservatives win the debate on campus than use the power of the state to unjustly banish ideas we don't like.\n	>>	Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does.\n	\n	Like what? Let’s hear some examples.\n		>I think that He means to say that the left de-platform those that they disagree with, which is similar, although not exactly the same, as de-platforming an idea. To give an example of that, although I know that you didn't exactly ask for this, Richard Dawkins being de-platformed for his 'offensive' ideas on Islam.\n	>Lots of misunderstanding of the word theory in these discussions. Theory means it’s been tested rigorously enough to be accepted by the scientific community. Theory is conflated with hypothesis, which is the untested phase. A theory is all but proven. Evolution is a theory because it’s been tested. \n	\n	Flat-Earth is NOT A THEORY. It has no evidence or scientific consensus. \n	\n	CRT, while I don’t know much about it, I doubt it is supported enough to be a true theory. \n	\n	If we talk about banning anything, ban calling it a theory and giving it the scientific recognition that comes with that word. \n	\n	It’s bad enough people thinking evolution is “just a theory”.\n		>Theory in a liberal arts context is essentially a tested hypothesis and by tested I mean discussed and accepted by at least some group within the liberal arts world. In the case of CRT, it's been around for awhile now and has been adopted by numerous people as true. The problem is that there has been little to no pushback in academia because conservatives are grotesquely outnumbered and are actively denied admissions into Ph.D programs and tenure tracks. Conservative media is over a decade behind on this issue, CRT has been accepted and pervasive on college campuses and in K-12 for some time now.\n	>It’s not an actual “theory”. It’s social engineering.  GFY with that dishonesty.\n	>I think the only problem is you can't debate these topics.

Conservative,t3_nvug3o,h15ip98,">As much as I like Clarence Thomas, I would hate for this to happen.  Google is a private company and there are alternatives readily available if you don't like them\n\nIts different than the infrastructure required to run natural gas or electricity where it is pointless to run parallel lines to every home\n	>Google has a monopoly on the way I get my information.\n		>In what way?  Duckduckgo is based on Bing, Reddit is hosted by AWS, I use an iPhone, what do they do that can't reasonably be done on a different website?\n			>Who owns Bing? Microsoft\n				>Correct.  None of the companies I listed are Google or owned by Google\n		>Further more it's a monopoly that originated from government intervention in the market...Google didn't develop their GPS systems, they didn't put the satellites in space... The US gov did....\n			>And the government does allow unfettered use of the civilian GPS signal.\n				>My point being is a gov made monopoly is typically so strong the free market cant compete against that, it requires further gov intervention to reverse course\n					>Then why bring up a point that doesn't support your point or isn't relevant to the point?\n						>It is relevant.\n						\n						This discussion is about should further government intervention be used to reverse government created monopolies which is nearly all of our tech companies propped up by the US gov.\n						\n						I support free market enterprise, the US gov putting golden nuggets of technology in the hands of insiders is what the problem is.\n						\n						We are only focused on the indirect impact on us like Twitter censoring and blocking people on a product that was developed by the US gov, then sold off...\n						\n						Another example being Tesla only being profitable because of carbon tax credits.\n						\n						Another example being Amazon only being profitable because of defense contracts and the gov outsourcing it's data centers to them.\n						\n						Gov intervention across the board and all we worry about is saying these are private companies with no ties to the gov and should be viewed as such which is false.\n						\n						I argue the US gov is strangling the free market by putting state sponsored business in place like how the Chinese government does.\n						\n						The only hope we have of combatting government take over of the market place is by using the government to restore control to the market place and not having government chosen men monopolize everything...\n						\n						Ideally we just say get rid of government sponsorship but the technology and market saturation is already in place to keep these monopolies here for decades to come.\n						\n						There is no way to restore free market innovation while government monopolies remove all incentives and dominate the market place because of government contracts bolstering their bottom line from red to black.\n	>There are alternative electric companies. Or alternative internet companies.\n	\n	Ya know. Until there aren't in some places. Sure there are competitors but to deny the issues of algorithm manipulation is absurd. How else do we address those issues?\n		>You address it by using a different search engine that better reflects your needs as a consumer.  DuckDuckGo (partially powered by Bing), Bing, Baidu (Chinese only), Gigablast, or other tailored engines/country’s engines.  Each of these are powered by different search algorithms in case you object to the algorithms instead of the search engine itself.  If you only object to the engine, then there’s plenty more out there to choose from.\n			>My needs as a consumer are irrelevant here. Its not about the consumer. \n			\n			The issue is this one search engine is used by lets say a conservative estimate 80% of the country for all their searches. Its likely higher considering 'Google it' is common nomenclature meaning to look something up and Google is the default go to for the most popular browser, Chrome. \n			\n			Anyway. 80% of people use exclusively one engine. And that engine has a bias, but isn't clear about that bias. It actually actively hides that bias from those not paying attention.  So if that search engine has the reach of 80% of the populace, and influences what they see and how they perceive the world and its threats BECAUSE they can influence what people see...\n			\n			You and I and all conservatives changing search engines doesn't fix the issue at hand. The issue isn't that I see news I disagree with. The issue is others don't see legitimate news that disagrees with their preconceived notions. That Google actively suppresses the conservative and any ideas that don't fall in line. \n			\n			Google actively suppressed tulsi gabbard for 24 hours following her debate stage performance. The most critical time after a big TV moment and when people looked up tulsi they couldn't find any of HER stuff but rather other people talking about her. And magically 24 hours later you could find tulsi again. But the time to gain more support had passed. Google literally explicitly weighed a hand in suppressing tulsi in the democratic primaries. \n			\n			Us changing search engines does nothing about the fact that Google can and will influence the electoral process like that.\n",1623246885.0,2,hetero,no
