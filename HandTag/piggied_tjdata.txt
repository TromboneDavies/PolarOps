Conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h15aqjp,">I have followed CJ for awhile now. He is an impressive, dare I say, kid.\n	>Not long enough, apparently.\n	\n	I’d let him finish growing up before celebrating him; he’s already been through full grift cycles. Became famous for alleging that Obama had blocked him on Twitter but it turned out he was lying. Was hired as Ted Cruz’ youth director out of that. Turned himself into a consultant and scammed a bunch of money out of other young Republicans that wanted a national voice like he had, doing virtually nothing to help them but taking their money anyway. When that came out, he was fired. Then he dropped out of Republican circles and went to work for Bernie Sanders as a youth person. Dunno what happened there, but now he’s back as a Republican activist. \n	\n	Kid’s young, so I’m not going to hold ancient behavior against him for forever, I just think he’s still young enough that his history warrants a bit of caution.\n		>Wow, I wasn't aware of that at all. That's crazy. How can you consider yourself a conservative and support Bernie Sanders? lmao. Kid is obviously a little confused and maybe is still trying to find his own identity.\n			>It’s easy if you have no principles and are just out for yourself.\n				>Or, if you are young and malleable and susceptible to any new idea that sounds like it's a good one at face value.\n					>Certainly but it seems like his goal is not the cause, but rather money and clout.\n						>That’s quite the assumption\n							>One assumption deserves another.\n					>Or you are a grifter….\n				>I think that qualifies him as solidly conservative.\n		>Yeah, I would be cautious with him. He's as fickle as the wind.\n		>That smile is pretty infectious. Must be crazy to have that much charisma.\n		>Do you remember why he renounced conservatism, and how old he was? That was 5 years, maybe a little more. He was 13 I think. At the time he was taking flak for being a black conservative, even only at 13. He was getting hit left and right with 'why are you standing up for the racist party.' type things. A popular 13 year old 'youtube star' in politics getting blasted because he is a conservative black kid on a liberal medium. Of course he questioned what he was doing!   \n		\n		\n		And let's be honest, what 13 year old, even in politics, doesn't find Bernie Sanders fascinating. The dude has great promises and makes it sound like he can usher in a prosperous future. Of course he was drawn to that. Did you ever think that maybe Bernie is the reason CJ ended back on the Republican side?\n		\n		So many teenagers who are conservatives are constantly surrounded by hostile politics. Think of all the liberals around them. School, media, video games, and friends. The fact that he dabbled in another ideology, let alone a super popular one at the time, is not unheard of at all. In the past 3 years, he has been a good voice for Republicans.  \n		\n		One more thing, he did indeed do everything you said, but I tell you what, all those things are very huge characteristics of a politician. Possibly a good one, but we will see. We all make mistakes, especially as kids. So far, his mistakes are very forgivable and can be chalked up to learning experiences. To my knowledge, he has not replicated any of the bad mistakes.\n			>I think flip-flopping and grifting makes a terrible politician. He has charisma and confident speaking skills, which make for smooth politicians, not necessarily good legislators.\n			\n			I specifically noted that I wouldn’t hold it against him forever and that I’m not saying he should be blackballed, just that an ounce of caution is warranted considering his history and that I think he should be given the grace of anonymity to finish growing up/figuring out what he actually believes. Money talks. He clearly knows that. It’s a lot tougher to be certain of his political convictions when he’s not been consistent through obscurity or difficulty.\n			\n			Maybe he will be consistently conservative the rest of his life. Only time will tell— and that’s all I’m saying. Don’t celebrate him yet. Be cautious. If he’s still consistent in five years, then I’ll be much more willing to count his young missteps as just that.\n	>He's way too grown to be called a kid... Guy is a leader at minimum, and yes, I've followed him for awhile now too.\n		>I 100% agree. He has done a lot of work, but is still 18 (19 at the end of July) and going into his sophomore year. Dude can't even have a beer after a hard test, or a rough election cycle. I know I would buy him a beer!\n",1623243039.0,-99,2,-99,2
Conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h15mla2,">non-whites need to realize that they have to speak the fuck up against marxism ASAP, or be enslaved by it. non-action and silence is not an option. the early stage soviet union is literally repeating itself before our eyes.\n	>Who was the nfl player who wanted to start a conversation on police brutality and was pretty much shunned for standing for what he believed? The idea that “non-whites” don’t speak on issues is not true. It seems that the only time you want to hear their voice is when it’s convenient to your political beliefs. Also, the idea that we are turning into “Soviet Union” is nothing but a scare tactic. Are bread lines forming at supermarkets? Unemployment benefits are close to expire if they haven’t already, workers are having more flexibility to decide how they want their work place to be. This tactic is always used when Democrats are in power and nothing happens. The same issues that happened under Trump are happening under Biden, not only that but state and local governments are mostly thriving, aside from some areas of course, but the idea that we are turning into a communist country is far fetched at best.\n	>So we were engaged in a world war that went pretty disastrously for us, leaving our economy in shambles. So, the USA proletariat is rising up against the USA monarchy? Got it.\n",1623248563.0,-99,2,-99,2

Conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h155ab6,">Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does. It's one thing to say this theory is so extreme it can't be taught in K-12, which is focused on giving minors a basic education. It's another thing to advocate banning it on college campuses. College should be about the open exchange of ideas and rather than advocate banning it, Pearson should learn it and challenge it head on in debate.\n	>By this logic, universities should be teaching witchcraft and flat earth theory too.\n	\n	They don't teach those topics because they are obviously wrong, why would we make an exception to CRT?\n		>I think that this is an unfair comparison. No modern day politician believes in witchcraft, but many modern day politicians believe in Critical Race Theory. Even then, if we look at something like pure Communism via the 1850 manifesto, no one believes in that exact document anymore. Everyone who believes in Communist-esque ideology now is a neo-Marxist, neo-Leninist, or some pretty removed form from the original document. I bring this up to mention that people still teach classes on Marx's *Communist Manifesto* even though no one believes in that form of 'government' for lack of a better word.\n		\n		I think that it is fair to ban classes from teaching critical race theory in high schools, as it is a highly politicized topic, difficult to opt out of, very niche regarding much of history, and risks taking too much of a hardline 'this is the way that it happened' as opposed to just making it an idea that some people believe.\n		\n		I do not believe that it should be banned or even left out of from (optional) colleges curriculums however. In college, it is an opt in choice, and students' minds are far less malleable. Also, most people who take a course on critical race theory will be people who will be political scientists or history majors. Teaching highschool students as a whole is very different from teaching just history majors and political scientists, if they choose to listen.\n		\n		To summarize my feelings on the topic, I think that Critical Race Theory is a poor way to look at history, as it does not really allow for solutions. In spite of this, you have to remember when ideas are banned, you create unmoderated, underground groups of radicals. I would rather have the idea be taught at universities in the public eye where discourse can take place, than foster radical groups that promote unadulterated versions of their ideas.\n		>Some universities do teach witchcraft (history of it anyway) and discuss flat earth theory as a theory when discussing history.\n		\n		These were kind of bad examples to your point.  Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well, should be ban those?\n		\n		Banning the discussion of a subject or theory from academia just makes it taboo, and could even cause the inverse effect where more people seek it out considering it's now 'forbidden'.\n		\n		All theories should be up for discussion in post-secondary education.  It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			>Teaching *about* a theory is very different from teaching a theory as being correct.\n				>I agree, I didn't say I wanted CRT taught exactly the way it's being taught, I'm just saying outright banning the subject from even discussion at universities seems like a step too far.\n				\n				Again, banning something rarely gets rid of it, it just drives it underground.\n			>>It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			\n			Congratulations for contradicting your whole argument and making my argument for me.\n			\n			Do you honestly believe these CRT courses are looking at the topic in an objective, historical comparison? Have you seen any of the reading material or seen any speakers?\n			\n			Honestly, they have it set up brilliantly. They lecture you on how the entire premise of the country is flawed, and anything that goes against that narrative is used as evidence that the narrative exists.\n			\n			If you try to refute the goals of the founders using, idk their letters and articles from the time, then they just accuse you of defending the 'racist' system they founded.\n				>Except schools are teaching it as a serious established theory that you should consider believing yourself. The entire program is to convince you of its merits. Witchcraft classes don’t have that approach.\n			>> Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well\n			\n			Do they now ? Because most of the college people I've talked with apparently have little to no idea what any of those are.\n				>I can't speak for everyone but when I attended undergraduate my political science classes discussed the differences in ideology quite extensively as well as their similarities.\n				\n				Admittedly it's been about 16 years since I went to Undergrad, and my graduate degree is an MBA, so not much political science there.\n		>We don't need the government to ban the teaching of flat Earth or witchcraft.\n			>That's not really my point.\n			\n			Why aren't universities open to teaching those topics? Shouldn't they teach anything by your logic?\n			\n			Remember, universities are government sustained. You can easily make the argument when a university takes a position on something, they are backed by the government.\n				>Private universities aren’t public \n				\n				Colleges already essentially teach whatever they want including about those subjects\n				\n				It’s up to the faculty, administration, and students. Not the government. It’s academic freedom, something that we should take care not to infringe\n		>No, by that logic universities should be banned from teaching it, which was his point. Universities teach the bible too, which is just as wrong in many places.\n			>Universities teach the history of the bible and deconstruct the ideas behind it. Same thing with Islam.\n			\n			They don't convert the students to those religions in those courses like they do in CRT. In my experience, classes teaching about religion are more likely to promote atheism in the students than a more positive outlook on religion.\n				>Religious universities, which receive federal and state money, do teach it as truth. But you ignored his point, which is that the government shouldn't be involved in banning university curricula.\n		>Okay, I'm very much against CRT. But, I don't like the idea of seeing anything as 'obviously wrong' in an academic setting. Maybe it's my education background in STEM, but much of the innovation we make comes from things we once considered obviously wrong.   \n		\n		\n		There are pros and cons when information is free to be discussed.\n			>Then you've killed the entire purpose of higher education. \n			\n			If our universities, publicly funded by the way, start teaching 2+2=5 because we no longer believe in objective truth, than higher education is worthless.\n			\n			CRT is entirely based on numerous false premises. The idea that the nation's very foundation is racist, is false. The idea that we are nothing more than the average of our intersectional/post-modernist identity groups, is false. The idea that western society is the genesis for all evil in the world right now, is totally false. Honestly, Santa Claus is more believable than CRT.\n				>Don't spend a fucking paragraph explaining why something is bad that I've stated I don't endorse. It's pointless. And, no, not all universities are publicly funded.\n				\n				The ideas of Plank, Bohr, Shrodinger, Einstein, Oppenheimer, etc were all considered obviously wrong and based on incorrect presuppositions. When it turned out that the prevailing presuppositions were wrong. I'm not here defending CRT. I'm here defending the idea that the mainstream 'correct' think is not always right. And, using the 2+2=5 analogy brings a level of irony into this, as an adage to 1984. Freedom is the freedom to say 2+2=4. If that is granted, all else follows.\n				\n				'Right think' is being advocated on both sides and it's not just detrimental, it's downright authoritarian. The antidote to bad ideas isn't banning them. It's challenging them with good ideas. We used to believe this, at one point.\n	>So far I've seen laws, at least in the Oklahoma one, they don't really '' ban it'', they just forbid making it's teaching obligatory. They can still teach this kind of garbage, but they can't force you to take the class, nor they can make your grades depend on it.\n	>Just to gauge where your lines would be; do you feel that should apply to tax-funded public schools, or only privately funded ones? Do you also advocate for the teaching of sexism in universities? Or just racism? Because CRT literally advocates for (actually) institutionalized racism. \n	\n	I totally get your point! That the idea of 'cancelling' ideas we don't like makes us not much better than the unhinged lefties! Consider though, that the idea of suppressing abhorrent and dangerous world views isn't new. We 'cancelled' tf outta Hitler for using CRT to 'other' the Jews. Do we not generally try to eliminate, or *cancel* racism? How would opposing CRT be any different than opposing any *other* form of racism? I'm just trying to figure out if you support the idea of teaching racism in general, or if this one specific form just feels different to you somehow. \n	\n	As easy as the idea of standing idly by allowing evil to thrive sounds, sometimes in life we've gotta stand up for our principles. Assuming we have any. Sometimes good *has* to cancel evil, or we condemn entire future generations to the consequence of our complacency. It's not really the same as trying to ruin someones career and life because they uttered some word 20 years ago that we don't like.\n		>Frankly, I would do away with government education in the first place. There should be a separation of education and state. \n		\n		Having said that, the government did not ban National Socialist ideology. In fact, many progressives thought fascism was great in the 1920's and 1930's. Communists opposed the fascists, until the Hitler-Stalin pact and then fascism was fine. Until the war anyway. After National Socialism had been defeated and the horrors of death camps discovered the government didn't need to ban Nazism or eugenics, these doctrines were naturally abandoned. \n		\n		I would much rather conservatives win the debate on campus than use the power of the state to unjustly banish ideas we don't like.\n	>>	Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does.\n	\n	Like what? Let’s hear some examples.\n		>I think that He means to say that the left de-platform those that they disagree with, which is similar, although not exactly the same, as de-platforming an idea. To give an example of that, although I know that you didn't exactly ask for this, Richard Dawkins being de-platformed for his 'offensive' ideas on Islam.\n	>Lots of misunderstanding of the word theory in these discussions. Theory means it’s been tested rigorously enough to be accepted by the scientific community. Theory is conflated with hypothesis, which is the untested phase. A theory is all but proven. Evolution is a theory because it’s been tested. \n	\n	Flat-Earth is NOT A THEORY. It has no evidence or scientific consensus. \n	\n	CRT, while I don’t know much about it, I doubt it is supported enough to be a true theory. \n	\n	If we talk about banning anything, ban calling it a theory and giving it the scientific recognition that comes with that word. \n	\n	It’s bad enough people thinking evolution is “just a theory”.\n		>Theory in a liberal arts context is essentially a tested hypothesis and by tested I mean discussed and accepted by at least some group within the liberal arts world. In the case of CRT, it's been around for awhile now and has been adopted by numerous people as true. The problem is that there has been little to no pushback in academia because conservatives are grotesquely outnumbered and are actively denied admissions into Ph.D programs and tenure tracks. Conservative media is over a decade behind on this issue, CRT has been accepted and pervasive on college campuses and in K-12 for some time now.\n	>It’s not an actual “theory”. It’s social engineering.  GFY with that dishonesty.\n	>I think the only problem is you can't debate these topics. There's no really good answer, university is a cesspool.\n		>The answer to that isn't to copy the left and ban theories we don't like.\n			>I agree we shouldn't ban any subject, I just wish professors were mediators instead of indoctrinators.\n				>I wish they would stick to their area of expertise rather than add lefist talking points into each class. Mathematics doesn't require a discussion on race.\n	>Look at what’s happening around CRT my dude. \n	\n	Teachers getting fired for being critical of CRT, parents being thrown out of school board meetings, CRT being required without any public input. \n	\n	This isnt about college or the freedom to discuss ideas. This is about mandated propaganda forcefully injected into our country under the cover of the pandemic.\n		>Where is CRT mandatory?\n	>If we aren't teaching racism again black people is cool.....which it is not cool.\n	\n	\n	Than we should be teaching racism against white people is cool....which it is not cool.\n",1623239940.0,-99,1,-99,2

Conservative,t3_nvtlj8,h157mh4,">The media is so insanely powerful. In late April 2020 I helped my friend move after he recovered from covid. He was a little chubby and did smoke cigarettes. It got to the point where he had a o2 level of 86 and was rushed to hospital now with pneumonia.  They gave him hydroxychloroquine and he was back to new in 5 days.   He even had the bottle and shook it, joking that he’ll sell the remainder.\n\nWhenever I mention that story to my liberal friends who bring up hydroxychloroquine they say he must be lying. It’s not true and that my friend must be a Trump supporter.  It’s just absolutely insane.\n	>I also had a friend with the same condition who was saved by the drug\n		>I know this is an article by the shitstorm that is OANN but the brigading is heavy.  Forget the news, I’ve seen hydroxychloroquine prescribed and work for people in real life and that’s good enough for me.\n			>Psst, buddy, I'm selling a nose spray that totally keeps you from getting corona, AIDS, and dandruff. It's $350 a bottle, but absolutely works. \n			\n			I also sell essential oils and crystals. Go to my website and I'll hook you up.

Governors have their own corpses but hydroxchloroquine was known to work; doctors screaming from the rooftops and getting banned and some even labeled witchcraft.

Or alternative internet companies.\n	\n	Ya know. Until there aren't in some places. Sure there are competitors but to deny the issues of algorithm manipulation is absurd. How else do we address those issues?\n		>You address it by using a different search engine that better reflects your needs as a consumer.  DuckDuckGo (partially powered by Bing), Bing, Baidu (Chinese only), Gigablast, or other tailored engines/country’s engines.  Each of these are powered by different search algorithms in case you object to the algorithms instead of the search engine itself.  If you only object to the engine, then there’s plenty more out there to choose from.\n			>My needs as a consumer are irrelevant here. Its not about the consumer. \n			\n			The issue is this one search engine is used by lets say a conservative estimate 80% of the country for all their searches. Its likely higher considering 'Google it' is common nomenclature meaning to look something up and Google is the default go to for the most popular browser, Chrome. \n			\n			Anyway. 80% of people use exclusively one engine. And that engine has a bias, but isn't clear about that bias. It actually actively hides that bias from those not paying attention.  So if that search engine has the reach of 80% of the populace, and influences what they see and how they perceive the world and its threats BECAUSE they can influence what people see...\n			\n			You and I and all conservatives changing search engines doesn't fix the issue at hand. The issue isn't that I see news I disagree with. The issue is others don't see legitimate news that disagrees with their preconceived notions. That Google actively suppresses the conservative and any ideas that don't fall in line. \n			\n			Google actively suppressed tulsi gabbard for 24 hours following her debate stage performance. The most critical time after a big TV moment and when people looked up tulsi they couldn't find any of HER stuff but rather other people talking about her. And magically 24 hours later you could find tulsi again. But the time to gain more support had passed. Google literally explicitly weighed a hand in suppressing tulsi in the democratic primaries. \n			\n			Us changing search engines does nothing about the fact that Google can and will influence the electoral process like that.\n",1623246885.0,-99,1,-99,1
