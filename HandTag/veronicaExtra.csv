But point of clarification - in the last paragraph did you mean 'as of 2002' or 'as of 2020'?\n	>2002 which is based on the Wikipedia entry that was used as a source. There probably more recent counts but this is the one that was cited by the user who declined to edit their post.\n		>Yeah, I think it's gotta be way more than that now. According to the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2021/02/05/website-tracks-where-critical-race-theory-taught-at-us-schools/) (yeah, not the best source) it's now over 200 schools and that article links to this site: [https://criticalrace.org/](https://criticalrace.org/) which purports to be a list of universities that train in CRT.\n			>Interesting, beyond the 19 year gap,  the differences may also be due to the fact that criticalrace.org appears to use a broader categorization of what it considers CRT training activities. For example [Abilene Christian University](https://criticalrace.org/schools/abilene-christian-university/) has 'anti-racism bias and diversity training' for staff which appears to be standard [DEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_training) practices while [SMU Law](https://criticalrace.org/schools/southern-methodist-university/) has an explicit course titled 'Critical Race Theory'.\n				>FYI if you didn't spend much time on critical race. Org, it's only a collection of criticisms of CTR. Not saying that disqualifies any of its data, but it also may not be the best source for this information.\n				>Yeah, thanks for pointing that out. I wondered about how broadly the author defined CRT training (which is why I used the word 'purports').\n				>Apparently naming a school building after an alumni of color also counts as CRT.\n				>I think there are definitely more courses influenced, derived or informed by CRT which some may classify as CRT than are explicitly CRT. I can see how that would happen, hell; rereading the tenants of CRT reminded me of the style and points of a few Fresh Prince episodes like [S1:E17 'The Ethnic Tip.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air_(season_1))\n			>My question is: what counts as CRT?\n			\n			  According to that criticalracetheory.org, my [university](https://criticalrace.org/schools/university-of-maryland/) promotes and trains CRT via: students wearing anti racist shirts, the school reevaluating it's relationship with police and naming buildings after barrier breaking alumni of color. Do these fall under CRT?\n			\n			So it seems that the people who wrote the stuff on the site consider anything that aknowledges that people of color to be at a disadvantage is CRT.\n				>This website is copyrighted by the Legal Insurrection Foundation, and most of the schools listed clearly do not promote CRT (which is a distinct branch of theory) but are listed for often surface level gestures and symbolic moves.\n				\n				\n				It shouldn't be viewed as a reliable source.\n",2,Veronica,1623782108.0

Ask_Politics,t3_o06zmz,h1unmr3,">These ideologies don't have a firm, objective meaning to separate them all. Some folks may have personal daylight between these three or four things, but if you ask someone else, the distinctions may be different or unimportant or what have you. You have to remember, politics is not a closed system--people don't only use words once they've accepted a fixed definition ahead of time. Put another way, Reagan, Bush 2, and Trump all talked about conservatives and what they want. And all three had vastly different political platforms that to them meant 'conservative.' That's because these are organic terms that change their meaning over time as the electorate adjusts and changes, and when you try and overdefine various ideologies in an attempt to make things more clear, often it only makes things murkier.\n\nThat's why you've had people define the same concept in two opposite ways before. These things are not submitted to a High Panel Of Ideological Importance before folks use the words, and the benefit of having ideological language is that you don't have to clearly fill out the details but can instead use broad terms without specifics and feel content.\n",3,Veronica,1623767226.0

Ask_Politics,t3_nyc7ww,h1qx3uf,">So when you say 'immigration camps' what do you mean? The detention centers, or the temporary shelters that unaccompanied minors are being held at, or both, or something else? That could refer to different things, and it helps to be specific.\n\nRegardless of what the answer is--blaming either party for border conditions doesn't make a ton of sense. The bad conditions at detention centers have persisted through many different presidents, and neither party has been able to get us to a reasonable solution. Both parties are responsible for what things currently look like.\n\nTo respond to some of your friend's specific claims: \n\nThe problem is definitely not 'Democrats cutting the immigration budget': [Democrats didn't change overall funding of DHS when they took over, and they increased funding for facilities for children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/biden-border-wall-immigration-budget/2021/05/28/18836084-bff0-11eb-9bae-5a86187646fe_story.html) They're considering cutting funding for detention centers and border patrol in the future, but haven't done it yet.\n\n>He also says the camps can't just let the families go without DNA tests because there isn't a guarantee they aren't human traffickers\n\n[There was a DNA testing program piloted under Trump.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/26/ken-cuccinelli/trump-administration-using-dna-tests-crack-down-fa/) Republicans are trying to make it required, but it currently is not.\n	>I believe he was referring to the camps that were created under Obamas term and the ones currently being scrutinized for the poor conditions. \n	\n	And huh. Then what would he be referring to when he says they cut the budget?\n		>Detention centers at the border existed long before Obama. Obama did build more centers in response to a surge in 2014--most of them *better* than the pre-existing centers. That doesn't mean they were great, though. But they were cleaner, with more room, and air conditioning, which many of the older holding areas don't have.\n		\n		I'm guessing your friends was referencing the 'Obama built the cages' argument, which [this article explains a bit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/kids-in-cages-debate-trump-obama/2020/10/23/8ff96f3c-1532-11eb-82af-864652063d61_story.html). Some of Obama's new detention centers used fencing to separate different demographic groups of people (young men from families, etc.). This had been standard practice for a long time, but in the past they hadn't used fencing to do it. (They'd be kept in separate centers or separate rooms, things like that.) When Trump came into office, he decided to start criminally prosecuting families that had illegally crossed the border. This law had already existed, but previous administrations hadn't applied it to families. This left children alone in the detention centers without their parents, behind the fences that had previously separated different groups, which spawned a thousand news stories.\n		\n		Hopefully this helps illustrate that this isn't just the work on one administration, but of a lot of cumulative decisions by many administrations. The U.S.'s first modern detention center started construction under Carter and was opened under Reagan--although of course American detention centers date back to Ellis Island!--so it's been more than forty years of making the problem worse.\n			>Interesting. Thanks for the info. So I guess it's more of a cumulative problem issue. But what I am wondering is where did the budget statement my friend was referring to come from?\n",2,Veronica,1623688927.0
Ask_Politics,t3_nx7lcn,h1fxem4,">A quick note about cause and effect in situations like this given your note about the seeming incongruity of 1973 and Reagan. First of all correlation doesn't imply causation. It's very possible that the graph first started to really pick up in 1973 because of natural, reasonable market forces: technology has almost always made folks more productive, or it's possible there's was a bit of a shift in how businesses approached certain things which showed a noticeable increase in productivity, or in the natural curve here we would see some ups and downs and we just happened to have an up right then. The point is, lots of these concepts are very complex and multicausal, especially when we're talking about something as multifaceted as the American economy. It's tempting to look for the 'one thing' that perfectly explains a graph, but the reality is that quite often it's lots of things contributing and even your causal arguments will be somewhat incomplete. But let's not forget: a partial cause is still a cause, and something doesn't have to explain something 100% for it to be a contributing factor.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that sometimes the effect is delayed. So for example, Reagan dissolved the airline unions in 1981. This probably wasn't that big a deal in 1981. For one thing, less union dues put an immediate shot in the arm of workers that replaced those fired in 81. On top of that, a sudden enormous shortage of labor, combined with relatively expensive and time consuming training, combined with the absolute necessity of filling positions quickly, could have created a rather labor-friendly work condition until staffing levels rose and quality of hire started to level out. But once that system got back to a standard baseline...then all of a sudden workers have a lot less protections and wage growth stalls. So even if we didn't see an issue start to develop in this field for another half decade, that doesn't mean it wasn't at its core an issue with Reaganite policies.\n",3,Veronica,1623441929.0
Ask_Politics,t3_nutljv,h12st26,">So, the government doesn't have any direct control over your wages aside from the minimum wage. Companies decide how much to pay you as an employee. \n\nWhile the government technically has a lot of money and it is overly spent on defense, there are still things that require more money than they get now( infrastructure, education, VA, medicare, etc)  and historically saying you want to cut the military budget comes off as 'not supporting the troops'  and losses you votes. Also, in places where they manufacturer or cater to the military can also take a hit.\n\nWhich brings us to taxes. Taxes are as much as civic duty as anything else. It's the primary way the gov gets money. The primary function of the IRS is to collect those taxes( which are set by Congress). Failure to collect that money, even in small quantities can have terrible affects on our debts and deficits. \n\nRich people frequently hire tax lawyers to find loopholes to avoid paying higher taxes. So, while the tax rate might look high, most people don't pay anything near it. While not illegal, it can be harmful to the nation long term.\n\nMoreover, because they have lawyers they are harder to audit, so the IRS just goes for poorer people, because it's cheaper.\n\nSome say, well even if it's less than it's supposed to be, they pay more than the average person, which why technically true goes against the spirit of things.We're supposed to invest in our country. Warren Buffett famously paid less in taxes than his Secretary. \n\nRaising the minimum wage is a good idea and we should do it, but the people affected by it need all that money, since the cost of living has risen drastically.\n",3,Veronica,1623187500.0
