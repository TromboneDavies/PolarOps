That's the first thing to understand about why the more traditionally more left wing parties like Labour moved to the centre.  Thatcherism was pretty popular across the English speaking world at the time, and third way politics was considered the best way to adapt to what was popular at the time.  So that necessitated a move to the right and away from more traditional socialist values (that most people in these parties didn't have anyway) in order to get elected.  Which, referring back to rule one, is all that matters in the end.  In Canada the Chretien Liberals (really it was all Paul Martin) inherited a nasty debt and had no choice but to make big spending cuts.  This was actually a ploy by Chretien to hurt his Liberal rival Martin, by making him Finance Minister responsible for unpopular cuts to social programs.  Didn't work really, but that was the idea.\n	>To add to this excellent comment, the Labour Party's manifesto in 1983 was so unpopular and extreme it was dubbed 'the longest suicide note in history', but many in the party prefered maintaining their 'intellectual purity' rather than getting into office and changing laws. \n	\n	Basically people were just tired of losing, and third wayism/triangulation placed the focus of policy of providing what the electorate wanted, rather than what the committed party members did.\n		>>but many in the party prefered maintaining their 'intellectual purity' rather than getting into office and changing laws. \n		\n		This continues to be an issue to this day.\n	>> The first rule of politics is that if you don't win none of your opinions matter.\n	\n	And to put some numbers to this: Democrats had lost three consecutive presidential elections where their opponents had won more than 400 electors. That's an absolutely insane drubbing. No one's hit 400 since, and the only one to top 370 is, you guessed it, that Third Way Bill Clinton. \n	\n	The streak is worse if you consider Jimmy Carter's win was on the heels of Watergate. Absent that unique situation the drubbings went back to 1972.

Martin succeeded Chretien in 2003 and due to his unpopular cuts and the Sponsorship Scandal, he won a minority government in 2004 and was defeated by Harper's Conservatives in 2006. 12 years of Liberal rule ended thanks to Martin sort of being set up.\n	\n	He never really got to be PM and wanted the job ever since the 1990 Leadership Race.   \n	  Poor Paul :(\n		>I was a Martin delegate.

Those rights had to be wrestled from the industrialists.\n	\n	Reagan changed all that. Cracked down on unions. Dropped upper tax rates to historic lows, enabled the rise of Wall Street and the banking sector, and real 'capital'ism. \n	\n	Now, labor rights and safety regulations are seen by the new ownership class as impediments to profit.\n	\n	Don't forget, if it was up to the industrialists, we'd still have child labor.\n",1624034717.0,2,2,-99,2
Ask_Politics,t3_o2ibkb,h284474,">Basically, Reaganites. That's why. In the 80s in both the US and the UK, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had a similar brand of politics that deeply captured a whole generation. Reagan in particular not only DESTROYED his competition, but he also transformed his party and codified the future for modern conservatives. As Reagan turned over to his successors, he left politics but his influence remained. Society as a whole got a whole lot more supportive of extreme emphasis on the private sector and other economically right ideas, and for left of center folks to remain competitive, they had to move right on these issues. Clinton's shift to the right was a matter of self-preservation. Thatcher had a similar effect.\n\nNow, Reaganites are starting to get to be a bit older and their influence is waning as Millennials start to become of voting age. Plus, history hasn't been kind to Reaganite economic ideas, which has helped make these pushes to right seem unfavorable looking back.\n	>I would like to point out that 'Millennials' are mostly in their 30s, with some of us pushing 40. We have to do better to stop conflating millennials with Gen Z...we millennials have been of voting age for quite a while. Unfortunately, we are just unreliable voters, at least here in the States, because both our center-right party, the Democrats, and extremist-right party, the Republicans, are unpalatable and uninspiring because they are extremely out of touch. My generation is the largest voting bloc but the median age of Congress is 60, and with quite a few members pushing 90. It's also difficult for my generation to take over because there's still the GenXers and Xennials and my generation only controls about 2% of all of society's wealth - being that the Boomers are living much longer and refusing to step aside.\n	\n	The lurch into Gerontocracy is one of the most toxic and undiscussed burdens on our society, but that is a discussion for another time. Point is: anyone born after 1996 is not a millennial and saying millennials are coming of voting age is not only wrong, it's kind of derogatory and belittling.\n		>\>I would like to point out that 'Millennials' are mostly in their 30s, with some of us pushing 40.\n		\n		Yes, I know we're now official kinda old people, and kinda old people vote, young people don't. The reason that opinion on Reagan has started to sour so quickly over the last few years is because more 'young' folks are hitting political maturity--early to late 30s. Folks younger than that don't vote reliably enough to be a real bloc that can compete. Gen Z still has 10 years or so before their adults start being a force as a voting bloc.\n		\n		\>Unfortunately, we are just unreliable voters, at least here in the States, because both our center-right party, the Democrats, and extremist-right party, the Republicans, are unpalatable and uninspiring because they are extremely out of touch.\n		\n		I don't agree with this. I think more and more Millennials are coming to a better understanding of politics where they are moving away from that excessively ideological purist view. Millennials are becoming *more* reliable and starting to change the paradigm because they're going out to vote for whichever candidate they *most* like. I think you're describing your experience, but overall Millennials are jumping into the voting population at about the same age and about the same force as previous generations.\n		\n		\>being that the Boomers are living much longer and refusing to step aside.\n		\n		Right. The real issue here is that even when Millennials get involved, they're outnumbered by the Boomers and the Boomers aren't dying or retiring. Which, I get, and they shouldn't be forced to irrelevant themselves...but you're right that these are folks increasingly not invested in the future and are still the most powerful voting bloc and that's a very bad combination for society.\n		\n		So let me be clear: I'm saying millennials are coming of age politically. Most young adults don't get into politics right away. 20 somethings don't vote. Sure, SOME do, but not enough to make a generational stamp on politics. Every time a candidate tries to 'motivate the youth vote' he loses unless he's making a base in a different demographic. The rise of Pete Buttigieg was fueled almost entirely by 30-40 year old moderates and weak progressives--that's millennials. Buttigieg had the second strongest performance of any candidate.\n			>I concur with most of your comment, as a millennial whose voted in every election since I turned 18, my generation are a frustrating bunch - but you're right, my generation is starting to become more politically active, but as a left-wing voter myself (Bernie Sanders is center-left in my view), and one who's heavily involved in left-wing grassroots organizing, most center-lefters and left-wing voters still find both of our parties unpalatable, but the two party system is irredeemable and entrenched, and most of my compatriots aren't becoming less ideologically purist per se, we just know that to stop the extreme-right swing we can't afford to sit out on elections, even though I wish we would've came to our senses 4 years ago.... I vote Democrat but I'm still not a huge fan - though I am pleasantly surprised at Biden's willingness to open the door to progressives and leftists, yet the gerontocracy that is Congress is virtually intransigent for any policy left of hunting the homeless for sport (hyperbole, but you'll get my point).\n			\n			Anyway, more narrowly, my comment was coming from a place of frustration with Millennials not being given the proper respect, and still being thought of as kids. Certainly nothing in my comment is meant to detract from your overall points, most of which I agree with - even if I may not like it. There is one exception, however, in that I think Buttigieg's rise was more fueled by a large sect of Gen Zers, who are notably less left-leaning than my generation. But I haven't looked at the data so this is just conjecture.\n				>\>but as a left-wing voter myself (Bernie Sanders is center-left in my view), and one who's heavily involved in left-wing grassroots organizing, most center-lefters and left-wing voters still find both of our parties unpalatable, but the two party system is irredeemable and entrenched, and most of my compatriots aren't becoming less ideologically purist per se, we just know that to stop the extreme-right swing we can't afford to sit out on elections, even though I wish we would've came to our senses 4 years ago....\n				\n				Two things. One, you happen to ascribe to the most purist part of the Dems and I imagine you surround yourself with a greater than average amount of folks who think similarly. That's not a criticism--most of us attract people like ourselves, which is exactly why anecdotal evidence is so unreliable. So I think you're probably seeing more purity than there actually is, just like it's possible I'm seeing less (though I'd say most of the data support my reading more than yours). \n				\n				Two, even here you're admitting that there is more pragmatism and less purity over time even in your particular group. I'm a millennial that was calling out Sanders folks hard in 2016 for precisely the kind of thinking you're lamenting 4 years ago. I'm by no means saying that millennials are hardcore two party system fans, but I'm saying the same thing you're saying.\n				\n				\>though I am pleasantly surprised at Biden's willingness to open the door to progressives and leftists, yet the gerontocracy that is Congress is virtually intransigent for any policy left of hunting the homeless for sport\n				\n				Yes, this is what myself and other moderates have been saying about Biden ever since the beginning of the primaries and Sanders folks didn't want to hear it...but I digress. I think the issue you're hitting on is less a matter of gentocracy and more a matter of anti-majoritarian features of our system creating gridlock to an extreme degree. Plenty of really old folks are committed to major structural change--in fact, I think you could argue that the modern progressive momentum doesn't exist without Old Man Sanders and Old Bird Warren laying the path. The problem is that change of any kind requires on a level of consensus that is not reasonable to expect in any free society.\n				\n				\>There is one exception, however, in that I think Buttigieg's rise was more fueled by a large sect of Gen Zers, who are notably less left-leaning than my generation. But I haven't looked at the data so this is just conjecture.\n				\n				Yeah, take a look and you'll see that Buttigieg's base was youngish white folks who were mostly moderate but also kinda open to progressive politics. Basically, he cannibalized Warren's base, which is one reason Warren never got off on the right foot. You can see she started to realize this halfway through as in one of the debates she went after Buttigieg HARD and he held his own (I think it was the debate before she eviscerated Bloomberg). Of course, there are ton of millennial voters that were also fueling the Sanders/AOC side of the party. But if anyone was after Gen Z it was Sanders, both in 2016 and 2020, and in both cases he wasn't able to pull through because even though these guys are in their late teens and early 20s, most folks don't politically mature until after that (some vote still, but lots of the time they vote the same as their parents). \n				\n				I, too, get bent out of shape when folks bash on millennials for no reason and still think of us as being kids. Hell, I just had a kid myself! Political maturation just tends to happen well after regular coming of age. That's all I meant.\n",1624033349.0,2,2,-99,2
Ask_Politics,t3_o2ibkb,h27ytp3,">My cynical first thought is that they were in the early process of converting their respective governments into corporate vassal states.\n\nTony Blair was kind of led by the Bush administration and the post-911 world. They seemed to just follow the USA's lead on a lot of legislation and social policy, to the point that they eventually abandoned the EU much later, but as a result of the seeds sown in the early 00s.\n\nThe popular criticisms of the political left at this time (at least in the US) was that the left is composed of 'bleeding heart liberals' who are too soft on crime, allow welfare cheats to abuse the system and didn't have the balls to stand up to their enemies.\n\nRather than just digging in and counterattacking, they attempted to bend their ideology to show that they could do all these things while also providing functional governments that keep the trains on time.\n\nI would say finally that most of the progressive alternatives that are proposed in these nations are just empty bloviation. The politicians themselves are corrupt and enacting the will of the rich, while pretending that they care about the people.\n	>> My cynical first thought is that they were in the early process of converting their respective governments into corporate vassal states.\n	\n	...\n	\n	> The politicians themselves are corrupt and enacting the will of the rich, while pretending that they care about the people.\n	\n	The US was designed to protect the rich and powerful since it's inception.  Clinton was not the first to do it.  James Madison said that the government is there 'to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.'\n		>I don't think Clinton was the first, and yes, the US was for the most part at very least proactive in the aims of the wealthy. \n		\n		However, I think if you look at the post-WW2 era, you will see that the US was pretty progressive in a lot of ways. College was cheap/free, the rich were heavily taxes and unions were plentiful. \n		\n		This diverged under two administrations in my opinion and began the two cornerstones of the modern right wing era that dominated politics ever after. The Nixon administration was the beginning of the culture wars (a backlash against the civil rights movement and the hippy movement) and the Regan era was the beginning of the corporate dominance era (the birth of the 'greed is good' economic era). \n		\n		People like Clinton are against the culture war mostly (pandering to minorities, open to making holidays like MLK day or Juneteenth) but sympathetic to corporate dominance policies like nafta/worldbank and austerity measures. \n		\n		Modern Democrats still fit that mold, they pay lip service to things like anti-racism, while supporting policies that keep the poor subjugated. The Republicans still continue the culture wars against modern civil rights and BLM instead of the hippies of Nixon's era. But ultimately, the two parties barely diverge beyond these issues and the corporations have made a similar compromise of taking an anti-progressive stance economically while promoting their aims as progressive culturally.\n			>I get that the Democrats, as a major part of the two party system, are heavily influenced by corporate interests. But there is real daylight between the parties, it's not all just corrupt cronyism all the way down. In my lifetime Democrats have managed to pass real legislation that made millions of people's lives better in concrete ways. The party platform includes ideas that truly would benefit us all, especially with figures like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren pushing the party to take a more assertive stance for the working and poor against the oligarchs. I would much rather see President Warren than President Clinton, just as I would probably rather see Clinton than Bush.\n				>Yeah and that might have worked if Warren wouldn't have joined Clinton and the rest of the establishment democrats in sabotaging Bernie in the primaries. That's why I say that they pay lip-service to the public while keeping the same backroom deals. \n				\n				They aren't as in your face about their aims, but they aren't really opposition either. We still have insurance companies instead of public healthcare, we still have people mired in student loan debt, we have more people than ever going into poverty and facing homelessness. Bernie is the dream, the carrot dangled on a stick, Manchin is the reality and it is that way by design.\n					>Your argument against Warren joining the establishment is naive. To get anything done in Washington you need to be a part of the system or protest in the wilderness and hope your ideas become mainstream. I will use Bernie as an example, he did not join the mainstream, and it took decades of him protesting alone for his ideas to catch fire and become mainstream, plus you are forgetting that Warren started out a moderate republican.\n						>With all due respect, I think it is naive to regard Warren as anything but an opportunistic phony. \n						\n						And yes, I realize that Bernie spent decades alone, which makes it even more egregious that a fake progressive like Warren sabotaged him by lying about him (saying he made sexist comments) and staying in the primaries as long as possible for the sole purpose of diluting the progressive vote.\n							>'Opportunistic phony'? Is that why she was the single person who was probably most responsible for the creation of the CFPB, which protects consumers from financial fraud, monitors and regulates the activities of the financial sector, and has won millions of dollars in judgements for ordinary people that were defrauded by banks? I think it's hard to overstate just how difficult it is to create a strong new agency like this, and Warren worked really hard to make it a reality. If you only think of Warren as an opponent to Bernie, if you are going to judge her just for wanting to be president and for trying to win, then I think it is YOU who is being naive. She's one of the most progressive senators in Congress, so if you actually believe in achieving real progressive change, Elizabeth Warren is on the frontlines. Don't dismiss her as a tool her just because she criticized her political opponent at a debate one time.\n",1624030987.0,2,1,-99,1
Ask_Politics,t3_o2ibkb,h28p0it,">I'm guessing I'll be in disagreement with most of posters here, as I consider 'paradigm shifts' to be the consequence (rationalization), rather than the motive force of social changes. \n\nBut if I am to rely on my own experience, I can't sum up main reason as anything but 'fall of USSR'.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat you consider 'left-wing' (or economically left) position is centrist (or SocDem), as the whole point of it is to support status quo, even if it means sacrificing interests of one group or the other. Actual Left has alternative to status quo. Centre doesn't.\n\nThe general dynamic that kept Centre in power in most of 20th century was based on sacrificing actual left (socialist) policies to reach an agreement with capitalists (i.e. rich elite; not whatever can be considered 'capitalist' ideologically in US).\n\nBasically, you have some broad coalition (formal or informal, doesn't really matter) of 'united left' that presents some threat to status quo. Centrists then use this 'united left' to negotiate with capitalists, so as to acquire some concessions ('if you don't agree to our demands, bad evil communists might start a revolution or present much harsher demands').\n\nThis was the main drive of First World politics since Weimar republic (at the very least; the same dynamic can be applied to UK Liberal Party pre-WW1 and so on).\n\nHowever, there is a major problem with such a dynamic: if Left movements consistently fail to reach their goals, then people start going straight to centrists (as it is centrists who end up 'doing' actual things), weakening Left in process. But if Left  weakens, then it can't provide strong bargaining position to the Centre: centrists don't have anything to threaten capitalists with. Consequently, centrists have no option but to choose among themselves the most economically radical members to throw them under the bus together with proper socialists.\n\nI.e. the ultimate result of this dynamic is constant shift of political balance to the Right.\n\n* This dynamic doesn't work in the opposite direction as capitalists have a stream of wealth that can be invested into politics to sustain right-wing parties even if said parties never reach their goals.\n\nWhen Soviet Union was around, this shift was somewhat alleviated by its presence: even outside of direct support there was an example of Left politics providing practical results. Hence, there was a certain trickle of people into the Left.\n\nHowever, as Soviets started to weaken, First World Left started to lose ground as well. *Zastoi* period weakened position of centrists to the level that they lost to open Right-wingers (Thatcher and Reagan). Subsequent collapse of USSR (that begun with *Perestroika*) ensured that Left would not regain its power, and that there would be no return to the old compromise: capitalists would not accept it, as they have no reason to fear any revolutions.\n\nAnd this is how the dynamic I described above started to define politics since the 1990s: to get back into power, centrist politicians (ex. Blair) sacrificed economic demands and doubled-down instead on 'social' (as those do not really concern capitalists, while can be presented as some kind of 'achievement' to general population).\n",1624042710.0,2,3,-99,3

Part of the reason these states were willing to give so much power to the central government was the limited protections afforded them by the Senate (Each state has an equal say) and the Electoral College (Even small states have some say in who becomes president).

It does sounds like one. Feels like a concrete ethos which is antithetical to the idea of actual centrism.\n			>Fair. But my point is mainly that one shouldn’t have a concrete ethos. That they must take everything into consideration. I mean, wouldn’t the belief that one shouldn’t have a concrete ethos in itself be a concrete ethos?\n				>I would call open mindedness and pragmatism guiding principles. Yet even those are susceptible to themselves from time to time.\n					>Fair enough. I suppose it really depends on how one defines, “centrism.” But those things really are mainly my point. I guess I’m trying to elaborate on that.\n						>Remember I am talking about principles rather than manifest positions. There is definitely a difference. One is abstract. The other is not.\n							>True.\n								>I think centrism has become more of a political position than a lack thereof. I see a lot of people saying 'I consider myself a centrist' which to indicates a lack of understanding of what centrists. Undecided, on the fence and  or disenfranchised with a political party. Thats my interpretation of the centre.\n",1611475580.0,2,2,-99,2

centrist,t3_l3njkj,goarfh6,">I see Centrism as being unable to fully relate to either of the two major political parties or general ideals of 'the narrative.' \n\nI think gay people are wonderful, but I don't support Transgenderism. I don't appreciate my 8 year old son being exposed to Sexuality because a fellow classmate's parents have a very different, and offensive, outlook on life.\n\nI agree that systematic racism exists, Hell, an engineer once designed bridges so public transportation wouldn't fit under them on routes leading to beaches. Guess who used that system the most? But I also staunchly condemn BLM and victimizing Black people, such as disrespecting my friends and family by essentially saying Black people are too stupid to get ID's, etc., in order to bypass impending voter ID requirements/legislation.\n\nI think Christians are full of shit. But I also appreciate the low crime rates that come from living in a heavily religious society (Utah....).\n\nI mean, I guess I can see your point? But in most of the anecdotal experiences I've had, it just somehow always boils down to being the neutral party in any given situation.\n\nTo me, Centrism is choosing to align with my own moral compass, and not with any one political party. And generally, that leaves me right square in the center of any political affiliations.\n",1613962296.0,3,4,-99,4
centrist,t3_l3njkj,gp9101k,">Good post, we won't all agree exactly but you did a pretty good job imo. Centrism is like the adult in the room trying to solve problems while red and blue team are busy trying to bully each other into submission. The Reform Party is the centrist party btw.\n	>Precisely. And I’ll do some research on the Reform Party. Thanks for bringing it up.\n",1614560603.0,3,3,-99,3
