I can only imagine he said/wrote the wrong thing\n		>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/nyregion/median-home-brooklyn-mayor.html\n		\n		According to a note appended to a transcript of the editorial board’s interview with Mr. Donovan, he had sent an email several hours after the interview to say that his $100,000 answer referred to the assessed value of homes in Brooklyn, which tends to be much lower than their selling price.\n		\n		“I really don’t think you can buy a house in Brooklyn today for that little,” he wrote, according to the transcript.\n		\n		Jeremy Edwards, a spokesman for Mr. Donovan, said Tuesday that Mr. Donovan “misinterpreted the question and made a mistake.”\n		\n		“He had been volunteering on a complex housing assessment lawsuit and just got the numbers mixed up,” Mr. Edwards said. “As Shaun says, he is a housing nerd and public servant who has dedicated 30 years of his life to solving the problems of housing affordability and homelessness, and the wrong number slipped out.”\n	>Here, have a 40 minute .mp3 of cricket noises that will explain everything.\n	>If you read the full transcript, there was a clear misunderstanding.

The honest truth is that I misunderstood the question. I really don’t think you can buy a house in Brooklyn today for that little. When I answered, I was thinking of how we value properties for taxes, including homes and apartments. I have been in the weeds on these numbers while looking into a lawsuit regarding inequities in assessed property values in New York City. My housing nerd brain sometimes does this to me! But I do understand why people were so focused on my brain fart. The price of housing in NYC is out of control and far too many people have been forced to leave their homes. I have one of the most detailed housing plans in the race, which would drastically increase the amount of rental assistance to folks struggling to pay their rent and will adopt United for Housing’s call for $4 billion per year in capital funding for affordable housing production and preservation. Learn more about my Housing platform [here](https://shaunfornyc.com/issues/housing/).\n		>We have that issue in Indianapolis. Houses assessed at 80k that would sell for 160-200k on the market.\n		>> which would drastically increase the amount of rental assistance to folks struggling to pay their rent \n		\n		Aren't you treating the symptom rather than the cause?  \n		\n		It seems to me the major problem, but certainly not the only problem, is that workers are not paid reasonable rates almost anywhere in the country.  The price of housing will continue to increase, and as long as wages don't keep up, the necessary governmental assistance will continue to increase.  \n		\n		Why not focus on the income inequality that leads to many of these problems in the first place?  Would an increase in minimum wage or perhaps even UBI be better solutions?\n			>The best solution is to build a shit ton of high density apartments. More supply, lower price\n				>This right here. Subsidies only feed the abomination that is enormous landlords. Cut off their air supply by devaluing their capital and diluting their market share. Homes should be owned either by the people living in them, or by responsible community managers, not the decrepit thieves that inhabit most of the property industry at present.\n				\n				(And before someone calls me an illiterate communist for not wanting the poor to starve, I have managed *thousands* of rental units and understand the market better than most. I don't speak from passion, but cold analysis and experience).\n					>I do not totally disagree but my concern with forcing prices down is not about the rich landlords. It's more selfish than that. I live in the DC area and bought a house this year. If home values crash, I will be significantly under-water for my mortgage compared to my home's value.\n					\n					Of course, I think that everyone should have affordable housing. But I also don't want to lose what I have. I'm not sure what the solution would be for that.\n",2,TJ,1623161946.0

politics,t3_nv4qcy,h1183v2,">As a ~30 year old that is hoping to build a family in Brooklyn, I am very concerned about the state of the public school system. Even before the COVID mess, my perception has been that education in the city is very cutthroat and hit or miss, with students having to fight tooth and nail to get a decent education (through testing, selection criteria, etc.). Having come from a New England state, where education is a top priority, the notion of my future kids being left behind if the SHSAT sorts them into the wrong school is frightening.\n\nWhat will you do to ensure that education in NYC is both top of the country and provides a good education to all New Yorkers? What will you do to ensure that students have the skills needed to succeed in the 21st century?\n	>Thanks for your question! I’ve always said that my most important job in life has been husband and father, so I share your concern with giving your kids the best opportunities, and as a proud Brooklyn resident I’m so glad to hear that you're planning to build a family here!  \n	The first step to ensuring that all New York City children have access to a high quality education is making sure we’re actually investing properly in the areas where our education system is falling short. That means investing in a broader pipeline of teachers that actually reflect the communities they serve, creating more opportunities for family and community input in schools — and that has to include meeting people in a variety of languages and channels.   \n	I also completely agree that providing our students with 21st century skills must be a top priority. Given the digital nature of working in the 21st century, we need to start by bridging the digital divide in learning. This means providing affordable universal broadband across the city and making technology resources in and out of school more accessible. We also need to seize opportunities to train our teachers and partner with the tech sector to ensure our students are learning precisely what they need to thrive.\n		>Does this investment also mean increasing or decreasing funding for charter schools?\n",3,TJ,1623163364.0
politics,t3_nv4qcy,h11i5fg,">One of the parts of your platform that I'm most interested in is a variation of Cory Booker's 'baby bonds' program from his presidential run which tries to alleviate the wealth gap between socioeconomic groups. Could you explain how the Equity Bonds program would work and how you would intend to pay for it and how it would work?\n	>Thanks for the question! Yes, my Equity Bonds plan builds on Senator Booker’s baby bonds proposal and the similar proposal that State Assembly Member Michael Benedetto has put forth at the New York State level.  \n	What I’m proposing is to provide $1,000 to every child in New York City, followed by up to an annual $2,000 until they turn 18, with payments scaled based on family income. This investment would begin right away to tackle generational wealth disparities that play a fundamental role in systemic inequality.  \n	Under this program, a child born in poverty could receive up to $50,000 when they graduate high school, changing the economic trajectory of an entire family over generations. Equity Bonds will provide young New Yorkers access to a college education, home ownership, opening a business, and erasing debt, while accelerating the economic trajectory of our city.  \n	We’d pay for this in a few ways — first, by fighting for the Baby Bonds legislation passed in Washington, and I would leverage my deep relationships in Washington to get that done. Second, there's a $1 billion per year cost annually for students who are already born, and that would be paid for, dollar for dollar, from philanthropic funds and city funds — $500 million from City funds and $500 million from philanthropic funds.\n",3,TJ,1623167686.0
