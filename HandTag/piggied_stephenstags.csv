NeverTrump,t3_jod8td,gbd8w9r,>Drama queen.\n,1604685035.0,1,4,-99,4
NeverTrump,t3_jod8td,gb7d2fz,">Some of us are 'never Trumpers' because we're *not* conservatives per se... or even Republicans. I would encourage those contemplating the future of the GOP to remember that once their party spanned a wide spectrum of membership, including conservatives, moderates, and liberals. The 'moderate middle' is being ignored by both parties right now, but we're here for the taking if anyone will dare attempt to represent us.\n\nI *would consider* voting Republican if they went back to being values- rather than personality-based. And I will be even more likely to vote Republican if they put forward a candidate that is relatively moderate rather than a conservative purist. All of which I very much hope they do should this result be confirmed and Trump not be re-elected. But better a conservative with principles than a demagogue.\n	>Never Trumper is the slang phrase for specially anti Trump conservatives. It doesn't just refer to anyone who is opposed to Trump.\n		>Got it. I guess I aligned myself with it because I had tended to vote Republican but was horrified by Trump. But I did not consider myself a Republican or a conservative. Just more right of center than left of center.\n	>*Technically* (nitpick alert) the NeverTrump was a moniker assigned specifically to conservative detractors. :)\n	\n	It is always intriguing to remember there are centrists who can swing either way. I personally love conservative purism, though I recognize it can make someone unelectable. But I've always carried the conviction that conservatism helps the poor economically, despite everyone saying we're just here to make money.\n		>Yes, we're still around :-) I wanted a non-Trump candidate to consider from the GOP so I threw in with the NeverTrump cause. My impression is the Republicans in exile have been much more about ideas, the Constitution, etc. than the current party leadership. I'd love to see that come to the fore again.\n",1604557629.0,2,2,-99,2
NeverTrump,t3_jod8td,gb7a71u,">Two things.\n\nRepublicans are having a great night down ballot. Gains in the US House, when they were expecting to lose seats. Democratic majority will be razor thin. Republicans continue to hold many state chambers. \n\nSecond, many Republicans are outperforming Trump. This is a lot of hope.\n",1604555394.0,2,3,-99,2

NeverTrump,t3_jod8td,gb7ad2h,">I am still in the camp Republicans hold the Senate. The run offs I think will favor Republicans. People will want a check on Democratic power.\n	>There is that, but it's a slim hope. Democrats have been out-raising and out-spending Republicans in the last few months according to what I've read. And if D.C. and PR gain statehood, the GOP advances in the House will be worthless. I have no idea why House Democrats are about to crucify Pelosi. They've probably got nothing to worry about.\n		>The run offs will be before the next Congress is seated.\n",1604555523.0,2,2,-99,2

NeverTrump,t3_jod8td,gb7bnra,">I'm a center-left type that's lurked here for a few years, and personally I plan to help your party in what ways I can. I never want a Trump again, or the damage another one would do to our country. I'm in an open primary state and will just be voting in Republican primaries from this point forward for the most boring and qualified candidate your party can muster (maybe Nikki Haley in 2024 if you all can't find a true center right candidate to run), especially if Democrats have an incumbent president. \n\nI really have absolutely no idea why you think Republicans did badly though, you all gained seats in the House, and you all will keep the Senate. NC isn't going to go to Biden, much less the Cunningham, who is running behind Biden. Georgia will very likely have two runoff Senate races that Democrats will throw hundreds of millions of dollars into only to lose by 10% in both races. \n\nEven if Democrats did get 50 seats half your doomsday scenarios just aren't things we are actually willing to do. Adding more judges to the courts is popular on Twitter but not so much with actual Democratic voters, and the AOC wing of the party is honestly a small enough minority in the House that they can't even prevent Pelosi from passing what she wants with just the Blue Dogs. \n\nBut really, Democrats aren't going to take the Senate, and the next 4 years are going to be similar to the Trump years but with a few differences. The main difference is that no judges will get voted on at all, opposed to just confirming everything. The similarities will be greater though, all legislation will be DOA, and Biden will govern like Trump has, through executive orders. One avenue Trump handed Biden on a golden platter though was his declaration of a national emergency to try to build a wall. Not only did this fail spectacularly, but it gives Biden an avenue to just declare things national emergencies to direct federal funding, regardless of what Congress wants, and you do absolutely have Trump to thank for that.\n\nThe best change of course over the next 4 years is that the president won't be a constant embarrassment and disgrace towards our country, and he won't actively be trying to destroy our democratic institutions and norms.\n	>Great post. Good to have you.\n	\n	> I really have absolutely no idea why you think Republicans did badly though, you all gained seats in the House, and you all will keep the Senate. NC isn't going to go to Biden, much less the Cunningham who is running behind Biden. Georgia will very likely have two runoff Senate races that Democrats will throw hundreds of millions of dollars into only to lose by 10% in both races.\n	\n	We just watched a 10-point lead for Michigan candidate John James vanish in 24 hours courtesy of mail-in ballots. Tillis has less than a 2 point lead. I don't see any reason why the same thing won't happen there. It's a 96k lead we're asking to maintain through the blue shift.\n	\n	As far as Biden, there are reasonable expectations that he will not remain president for the entirety of his term. His debate coaching staff is evidently the greatest of all time for helping him to such excellent performances, because the remainder of his appearances are rife with heartbreaking gaffes and confused looks. And the cynic would say that Nancy Pelosi did not wait four years to assemble a 25th Amendment Commission to remove a GOP president projected to lose horribly in under a month. That's a borderline conspiracy theory, but it would fit Pelosi.\n	\n	If Kamala Harris does become president, talk of a moderate presidency are pretty much out. And as far as the doomsday legislation goes, there is no precedent for these times. Political rhetoric always hides its idiots. Right-wing outlets never talk about the morons in their party, and left-wing news is similarly tailored to reassure its moderates that their party isn't nuts. It's why Fox News viewers have no idea that white supremacist violence still happens all the time, and why NYT readers had no idea what actually happened in Seattle's CHOP/CHAZ/CHIM-CHIM-CHIRREE/whatever until Nellie Bowles broke ranks and laid it out. \n	\n	So when you look at it through the real lens, I see those Twitter activists prompting big businesses, universities, churches, journalists, Supreme Court nominees, dictionaries, and everyone else into doing whatever they want - deleting Tweets, firing individuals, changing policy, you name it. It isn't difficult to imagine Congress following suit. We're in the endgame of the political correctness movement, and like you said, Trump has handed them a number of tools.\n	\n	I fear the presidency will be an embarrassment and disgrace - just not in the way Trump was. But YMMV.\n	\n	Nikki Haley would be amazing. I hope she has a shot in 2024. It'll be wonderful to stump for a real leader again. \n	\n	I hope you'll stick around, MASL.\n		>> Tillis has less than a 2 point lead. I don't see any reason why the same thing won't happen there.\n		\n		Only 5% of the vote left uncounted in NC is the main reason, there was a lot more uncounted in MI. If Tillis goes down you are also taking about Biden carrying NC by like 2 points, I just don't see it at all. \n		\n		> As far as Biden, there are reasonable expectations that he will not remain president for the entirety of his term.

That's a borderline conspiracy theory, but it would fit Pelosi.\n		\n		I think Biden's still fully with it, he's just old, and you lose some sharpness when you age, but gain wisdom, which is what we need right now. Not to get too personal by I have close family that's going through some sort of dementia/alzheimers, and it's nothing like Biden.\n		\n		> If Kamala Harris does become president, talk of a moderate presidency are pretty much out. And as far as the doomsday legislation goes, there is no precedent for these times.\n		\n		Harris is neither as far right as leftists thing, nor as far left as conservatives think. She has a pretty mixed record, largely because she isn't really as ideological as a lot of Democrats, which could be good and bad. I suspect if she's president her primary goal will be getting reelected, and she's smart enough to know she has to appeal to moderate voters to do that. \n		\n		> Right-wing outlets never talk about the morons in their party, and left-wing news is similarly tailored to reassure its moderates that their party isn't nuts. It's why Fox News viewers have no idea that white supremacist violence still happens all the time, and why NYT readers had no idea what actually happened in Seattle's CHOP/CHAZ/CHIM-CHIM-CHIRREE/whatever until Nellie Bowles broke ranks and laid it out. \n		\n		I'm not saying the nutjobs on the left don't exist, I'm saying they don't have nearly as much power as you think. \n		\n		> Nikki Haley would be amazing. I hope she has a shot in 2024. It'll be wonderful to stump for a real leader again. \n		\n		I think she's a fundamentally decent person, who would protect US interests and democratic norms, and who would push terrible but mostly well intentioned policies. Honestly in this polarized climate I think that's the best that we can hope from each other across the aisle. I wish more conservatives would view Biden that way because I do believe he's fundamentally a really good person who will work in what he thinks is in the best interest of our country.\n			>I actually think there are many conservative pundits who find Biden likeable. (Of course, I tend to follow the more balanced pundits.) Generally speaking, we tend to guard against even likeable liberals because we strongly find liberal *policies* to be destructive despite their intentions.\n",1604556520.0,2,2,-99,2

Fact: more people AND businesses leave California each year due to overregulation, high taxes, high cost of living, superficial Hollywood newcomers, overcrowding, my God, there must be much more! I’m sorry it wasn’t contained in California, the disease has spread certainly and regrettably to Washington state, Oregon and Colorado. It has spread to most other states as well. It was clearly done - it seems like certain companies that attract a certain type of people decided to set up camp in the most densely populated cities thus infecting most large cities. The infection also emanates from schools of all grades through university. The talk was BIG: The media was bought, all 6 major companies organized through ProPublica to coordinate local, regional and national news sources. Corporate was bought to push the agenda through policy in ads, social media, employees. Polls were bought to see the real results and relay false results.\n	\n	The talk was so BIG it fooled the average sheep. \n	\n	\n	We later learned that whole branches of government AND government agencies had failed to protect our checks and balances as hours and hours of testimony and physical hard evidence of voting and election fraud were collected and made public. The media with 95% control of all media withheld the information. Luckily some trickled through.\n	\n	Biden campaigned the least of any political candidate in the history of the United States. Pulled the least number of supporters to rallies (and video views for covid paranoids). The rap sheet for the crime, the motive, lack of sincerity and admission of guilt on video uttered by his own mouth + Time Magazine’s own admission show that the guy cheated and did not win lawfully. The Supreme Court was supposed to hear the court cases even if to still deny the doubt of election integrity. Were they bribed? threatened? Or worse? Was it to prevent a civil war? Shut the BLM and Antifa up? To protect the citizens? Are lives more important? What did the veterans of all prior wars die for then? To allow socialism, tyranny, communism? To allow hundreds if not thousands kill themselves with this endless present? Alcohol, suicide, extreme poverty, depression, isolation. Not allowed to socialize? Congregate for religion? Kids developing social anxiety? and not learning in school anymore? Learning Marxism? Learning to hate their country? That they are racist before they even know what that is?\n	\n	Truth is all we got. We have been fighting the communist war since March 2020. Biological warfare resulting in a healthcare state. The medical field is plagued by parties holding a stake in the money made. Workers are deluding themselves about how it really is - they went through the schooling and depend on their job to live. Others are making a pretty penny off incentives to diagnose covid positive. Insurance billing, supplies, pharma, hospitals, doctors. How much did you pay for a rapid test before your flight to Boston where they say you must pass the test before your flight - some paid $400!!!! BTW - no one checks for it!!!! Yes, no one asked for it! Gotcha!!! And only 1 WHOLE YEAR later, they just decided they got too many false positives and turned the PCR thermocycler cycles down. Magically! The number of cases are down! BTW we got reports early on that they constantly had false positives. Yes, too many bad apples were bought and paid for, killed or somehow silenced to not speak the truth.\n	\n	The average sheep bought the whole BS To cheat the election using all means used in the past (exemplified and perfected in California and New York) and using as many mail in ballots as physically needed. The people today had more information than at anytime in the past. Many played stupid and all suffered the consequences. This is a lesson for Libertarians. You can’t just let the government run itself and expect it to not get out of control at some point. It’s gone WAY WAY haywire!\n	\n	I’m sorry my friend! I did not intend to point my whole book at you. I intended to put this out, but not put a spotlight on it as an OP. I hope someone learns something here!!
