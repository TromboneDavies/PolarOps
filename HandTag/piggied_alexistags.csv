politics,t3_nvck8u,h13wgxu,">I know the focus is on Virginia and New Jersey tonight, but something incredible is happening in Mississippi.\n\nDems have flipped multiple Mayor and City Council races, including in Trump-won cities.\n\n[Check out the rundown](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/nvkqi4/june_8th_victory_thread_dems_won_big_in/)\n	>This is some of the reasons why republicans are desperately trying to rig the game. They know their days are numbered if they can’t cheatv\n		>In Mississippi? Oh, Republicans have rigged the game there for years. They have no early voting, and you can only vote early if you meet some extremely restrictive circumstances. They disenfranchise felons, they have very difficult voter ID requirements, and they tend to move polling places with no notice.\n		\n		Dems still won tonight despite all that.\n		\n		This is what bothers me about the voter suppression discourse. Voter suppression makes it hard to vote, but not impossible. It's still wrong and I would love to see manor voting reforms passed. But if we don't, it's not the end of democracy. We simply have to work harder to get out the vote.\n			>The voter suppression in upcoming bills is bad, but it's not what's leading to the apocalyptic speech in people who are really looking into it.\n			\n			It's the changes in law like GA and AZ have done so far, with other states like TX following, that take the electoral process out of the Secretary of State's hands and into partisan actors, like either the batshit legislature in GA, or the batshit AG in AZ.  In AZ, they timed the legislation to end when the current Dem SoS's term is over; it's blatant.\n			\n			Beyond that, the gerrymandering in the pipeline will likely give the House to GOP, and it's pretty clear that they won't certify the next President unless they are a Republican.\n			\n			The suppression is bad, but the groundwork being laid for outright fuckery combined with an apparently clear willingness to use it is what's scaring the shit out of us.\n				>Jamey, is that you?\n				>You're right. SoS can just deny Democrat winners of elections. Democracy is dead and we are now as a nation under one facist party rule for the rest of my miserable life.\n					>So this is an idea that's become popular lately. But it isn't true.\n					\n					The legal precedent is clear as day: you can't just ignore the results of an election and seat whoever you like. That's been made abundantly clear over more than two centuries of law.\n					\n					And yes, I'm aware of all the Trump-appointed judges, and the state of the Supreme Court. Remember when they refused to even hear Trump's arguments in November and December? And Trump is their king, more important than any other Republican! It's not as simple as 'we're just going to overturn the election', and never was. If it was ever going to happen, it would for Trump.\n					\n					Now, there's a way Trump or someone similarly awful could win again. It requires no new laws, no brilliant maneuvers, or anything. Here it is: **convince enough people there's no point, then watch them not vote while his base come out to the polls**. That's what worries me, not fantasy scenarios about throwing out elections.\n					\n					Since 2020, Dems have done a lot of winning at the local and state levels. Just last week, they over performed Biden in a race for Congress that the GOP would have loved to win. Last night, they overperformed Biden in a State House race in New Hampshire - despite a bunch if outside spending. (And by the way, NH is under total Republican control at the state level, but they don't seem poised to throw out the result in a race they could've won).\n					\n					Online it looks dark and gloomy. Out in the real world, amazing things are happening. I hope you'll come check it out.\n					>I think doomer points of view like this are actually a form of voter suppression and, whatever your intention is, discourages involvement. \n					\n					If we're just stuck in a fascist tailspin, why even do anything? Which is ridiculous, because there are plenty of reasons to fight and realistically there's lots of tiny little victories happening all over the place.\n	>I think something important about super downballot races that people don't consider is that it's like a farm team for future political talent, and not only that but when it comes to city council stuff, they provide constituency services and often times get a small purse of discrectionary funds to build political power in the community.\n",1623207207.0,4,4,3,-99

When I first turned 18, I only really knew about elections for the big seats (president, house rep, senator, governor, mayor). And it wasn't until I was a few years older I realized just how many elections could take place every 4 years, and how important the more local elections are.\n	\n	It's also super satisfying when you feel like your vote means something. When I lived in Wisconsin, I helped to elect Jill Karofsky to the WI supreme court, lessening the conservative stranglehold on the court.\n	\n	Your vote matters, and that is true of every single time you vote.\n		>it wasn't that much in the grand scheme of things, but I do remember having voter's paradox completely cured taking part in local elections where the mayor defended their position by 3 votes. even better seeing them the next week walking downtown and having a miniature 'we did it' moment\n	>That's awesome! :D\n",1623209020.0,3,3,2,-99

conservative,t3_nvtzcg,h15aqjp,">I have followed CJ for awhile now. He is an impressive, dare I say, kid.\n	>Not long enough, apparently.\n	\n	I’d let him finish growing up before celebrating him; he’s already been through full grift cycles. Became famous for alleging that Obama had blocked him on Twitter but it turned out he was lying. Was hired as Ted Cruz’ youth director out of that. Turned himself into a consultant and scammed a bunch of money out of other young Republicans that wanted a national voice like he had, doing virtually nothing to help them but taking their money anyway. When that came out, he was fired. Then he dropped out of Republican circles and went to work for Bernie Sanders as a youth person. Dunno what happened there, but now he’s back as a Republican activist. \n	\n	Kid’s young, so I’m not going to hold ancient behavior against him for forever, I just think he’s still young enough that his history warrants a bit of caution.\n		>Wow, I wasn't aware of that at all. That's crazy. How can you consider yourself a conservative and support Bernie Sanders? lmao. Kid is obviously a little confused and maybe is still trying to find his own identity.\n			>It’s easy if you have no principles and are just out for yourself.\n				>Or, if you are young and malleable and susceptible to any new idea that sounds like it's a good one at face value.\n					>Certainly but it seems like his goal is not the cause, but rather money and clout.\n						>That’s quite the assumption\n							>One assumption deserves another.\n					>Or you are a grifter….\n				>I think that qualifies him as solidly conservative.\n		>Yeah, I would be cautious with him. He's as fickle as the wind.\n		>That smile is pretty infectious. Must be crazy to have that much charisma.\n		>Do you remember why he renounced conservatism, and how old he was? That was 5 years, maybe a little more. He was 13 I think. At the time he was taking flak for being a black conservative, even only at 13. He was getting hit left and right with 'why are you standing up for the racist party.' type things. A popular 13 year old 'youtube star' in politics getting blasted because he is a conservative black kid on a liberal medium. Of course he questioned what he was doing!   \n		\n		\n		And let's be honest, what 13 year old, even in politics, doesn't find Bernie Sanders fascinating. The dude has great promises and makes it sound like he can usher in a prosperous future. Of course he was drawn to that. Did you ever think that maybe Bernie is the reason CJ ended back on the Republican side?\n		\n		So many teenagers who are conservatives are constantly surrounded by hostile politics. Think of all the liberals around them. School, media, video games, and friends. The fact that he dabbled in another ideology, let alone a super popular one at the time, is not unheard of at all. In the past 3 years, he has been a good voice for Republicans.  \n		\n		One more thing, he did indeed do everything you said, but I tell you what, all those things are very huge characteristics of a politician. Possibly a good one, but we will see. We all make mistakes, especially as kids. So far, his mistakes are very forgivable and can be chalked up to learning experiences. To my knowledge, he has not replicated any of the bad mistakes.\n			>I think flip-flopping and grifting makes a terrible politician. He has charisma and confident speaking skills, which make for smooth politicians, not necessarily good legislators.\n			\n			I specifically noted that I wouldn’t hold it against him forever and that I’m not saying he should be blackballed, just that an ounce of caution is warranted considering his history and that I think he should be given the grace of anonymity to finish growing up/figuring out what he actually believes. Money talks. He clearly knows that. It’s a lot tougher to be certain of his political convictions when he’s not been consistent through obscurity or difficulty.\n			\n			Maybe he will be consistently conservative the rest of his life. Only time will tell— and that’s all I’m saying. Don’t celebrate him yet. Be cautious. If he’s still consistent in five years, then I’ll be much more willing to count his young missteps as just that.\n	>He's way too grown to be called a kid...
