ModeratePolitics,t3_o15fku,h1yvc6t,">A bullet-point overview from the White House detailing what the Biden administration has done regarding immigration in these first few months. Topics cover:\n\n* Improved Processing of Unaccompanied Children\n* Removed Barriers to Unifying Children with Parents and Sponsors\n* Put in Place Orderly Processes and Protocols at the Border\n* Expanded Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity\n* Enhanced Migration Management\n* Addressed the Root Causes of Migration\n\nMy key takeaways:\n\n1. Not a great look by the administration to start this statement with mentioning '4 years of chaos and mismanagement'. Let the facts speak for themselves. \n2. I'm a bit skeptical about the numbers used, given the above. Since the processing statistics compare current values to those from March/April, one has to wonder why these were chosen over other options (start of Biden administration, this time last year, etc).\n3. Lots of attention for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This isn't necessarily a bad thing IMO, but certainly worth mentioning.\n4. The Biden administration does not reliably use the Oxford comma. Pretty sure that's an impeachable offense.\n	>Ugh, they actually do use it several times in this post. So they are inconsistent... which might actually be worse.\n		>Good catch. It appears the usage improves further down in the overview. I agree though; inconsistent usage is probably worse.\n			>To me, this is akin to the old Van Halen 'No brown M&M's' demand in their rider. Look at a document with inconsistent usage of the oxford comma, and you know it hasn't been carefully looked at.\n			>It is worthy of rebuking, censure or impeachment.\n	>>	The Biden administration does not use the Oxford comma. Pretty sure that's an impeachable offense.\n	\n	Absolutely unforgivable.\n	>> Lots of attention for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This isn't necessarily a bad thing IMO, but certainly worth mentioning.\n	\n	Well considering that is where the majority of our illegal immigrants are coming from it makes sense right?\n	>> The Biden administration does not use the Oxford comma.\n	\n	God Damn son of a .....\n		>I think we might be able to ask the Mods for a rule 1 exception here.\n	>>Addressed the Root Causes of Migration\n	\n	Allow me to contain my disbelief.

Solid plan.\n	>Question is has any party really done anything to fix undocumented immigration\n	\n	I mean only real solution to curbing undocumented immigration is lessen red tape, create point system to immigration, decriminalizing drugs possession, changing border safety mission to humanitarian/medical effort, go from criminal to civil with undocumented immigration, and offer more benefits to those paying income taxes/US citizens\n		>To add to that: we also need to offer fewer benefits to illegal immigrants, and we need to better protect our border.\n		\n		We can expand legal immigration while also coming down hard on illegal immigration.

ModeratePolitics,t3_o13gwa,h1yk9zm,">**John Oliver had a segment this week but can't link to it, and most articles that dealt with the topic are stale, behind a paywall, or a brief summary of the program with a link to the video included.  So this Policy review is from June 18, 2019.**\n\nThe topic is should the prison population have access to air conditioning?\n\nSome at least 13 states (some states have no data on this): Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisianna, Mississippi, Missouri, N. Carolina, S. Caroline, Texa, Virginia lack AC.\n\nWhy is AC needed? Because people who are incarcerated have various health conditions, some that can make dehydration and heat stroke a higher risk. Conditions like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, or psychotropic medication. This has in the past led to deaths from inadequate cooling.\n\nSome states refuse air conditioning as an appearance to be tough on crime. But Wisconsin, Arizona, Mississippi have already ruled that incarceration in extremely hot or cold temperatures violates the eight amendments.\n\nA few things to ask the community:\n\n* We never hear that prisons don't install heating (I'm from the northern states); why is AC any different?\n* Is the lack of AC against the 8th amendment?\n* Is the lack of AC a crime deterrent?\n* Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime or a place to rehabilitate, or both?\n	>>Some at least 13 states (some states have no data on this): Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisianna, Mississippi, Missouri, N. Carolina, S. Caroline, Texa, Virginia lack AC.\n	\n	There’s some seriously hot states on that list. There’s evidence that hotter temperatures lead to violent crime. So having a hot, angry populace with criminal tendencies seems like a terrible situation, for both the inmates and guards.\n	\n	As to why AC is different than heat, it’s not seen as essential to life in the same way. I never went to a school that had AC and have lived in homes without it. This is getting rarer, but at the time, I would have been hard pressed to be upset prisoners didn’t have AC when I was sweating my own rear end off. It can be expensive to retrofit buildings for it, and spending money on criminals is not popular.\n		>Thanks for your life experiences, I was also very similar to you growing up, it's would be different for a person with high blood pressure, asthma, or diabetes they would be vulnerable to high temperatures. \n		\n		Being cool on an 85-degree day or staying indoors vs a high humidity 105 and above day are too very separate conditions and AC in many contexts feels luxurious but when you are a ward of the state and they can't cancel school for excessive heat or you can't go to the refriedge to crack open a cold drink to cool yourself off experiences can differ especially on days of excessive heat warnings.\n		\n		Excessive heat is my main concern and creating liveable connections for all inmates. I feel our society should treat our lower class with some humanity as well. That was what I tried and believed failed to highlight.\n	>I think focusing on AC while not considering other measures to control temperature and ensure people don't overheat is flawed. I used to be a welder and the Texas summers could be brutal sometimes. But being indoors, out of direct sunlight with adequate airflow made for a pretty easy day. Even when I was in full leathers. Now do these same prisons have adequate airflow? Do they make water available in sufficient quantities? Now if they don't have AC, don't have adequate airflow, and don't make water available in sufficient quantities then that is a violation of the 8th amendment. AC is not required to satisfy the 8th amendment.\n		>At a certain temperature those other means of cooling don't work for instance the CDC doesn't recommend water misters above a heat index of 105. So what about those conditions?\n			>When the heat index is 105 outside, go inside. If they have sufficient airflow and access to water then that should be fine.\n				>There are conditions that will be at a higher risk or death because of heat, because 10 people died I would say that is not adequate advice for all inmates. Would you agree?\n					>Certainly, and inmates with medical conditions that make them prone to heat related issues should probably be moved to facilities that can accommodate those conditions. That is probably a fairly small number of people though.\n						>I don't know what size that at risk population is based on the data provided.\n							>That seems like a requirement to really make a judgement here. Without that data, the question is should AC be a requirement under the 8th amendment for all of the prison population? In my opinion, that answer is no because it is pretty easy to stay cool for individuals that don't have medical conditions that are exacerbated by high temperatures when they are indoors with access to water and adequate airflow.\n	>> Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime\n	\n	Prison under any conditions acts as a deterrent around [1.24% of the time](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/34351/1/557359392.pdf). If the cruelty of prison is designed as a deterrent, it's doomed to fail. If we proposed other policies similar to prison that would have a 1.24% reduction in their targeted goal, we'd (rightfully) disregard them.\n	\n	Oh, and in the US, [prison has 'on balance, no rehabilitative or deterrent effects after release.'](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0604-8)\n	\n	On the rehabilitation side, what we do [isn't effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762476/?_escaped_fragment_=po=96.1538). The mere teaching of 'life skills' doesn't (per the prior study) show any capacity for rehabilitation. In fact [our prisons have recidivism up to 20% higher than some of our peer countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743246/).\n	\n	So to get back to your question,\n	\n	> Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime or a place to rehabilitate, or both?\n	\n	It doesn't seem prison *can* have deterrent effects, so we should focus on solving why people commit crime to begin with and combine it with rehabilitation.\n		>Prison's primary benefit is incapacitation, not deterrence or rehabilitation.  Someone in a cell can't commit crimes against the broader public.  \n		\n		So even if we assume that prison is only 1% effective at deterring crimes in advance, it is nearly 100% effective at either (a) stopping crimes or (b) isolating the crimes to the inside of a prison while the criminal is still in jail.\n		>Well, prison is very effective at providing incredibly cheap labor.\n	>The prison system SHOULD BE about rehabilitation, as it claims, but the corporations running them would go out of business if that were true.  \n	\n	Also:  I doubt a lack of AC is a functional deterrent.  I can see criminals gathered, discussing criminal activities, when one says, 'I can handle being in a cage, I can handle getting raped, I can handle people trying to kill me...wait, they don't have AC in prison?  Ok, I'm out.'\n		>The primary purpose of the prison system is incapacitation, not rehabilitation.  We put people in jail so they can't commit more crimes out in society, not because jail is going to fix them.  \n		\n		If the goal was to 'cure' someone's propensity to commit crimes, jail would be a terrible place to do it.\n",1623845762.0,2,2,2,2
ModeratePolitics,t3_o13gwa,h1yleyh,">Willis Carrier was granted the patent for his Apparatus for Treating Air, the first modern air conditioner, on January 2, 1906. \n\nThe ratification of the Bill of Rights was completed on December 15, 1791.\n\nWas the entire US in violation of the Eighth Amendment for 114 years and 18 days? \n\nI'm being snarky here, but my underlying point is that just because circumstances change, that doesn't mean that the laws do. If people think there's a right to climate control, pass another amendment. But don't just say that it's so.\n	>Law has historically changed based on technology. Abortion rights are one of the major hot-button issues right now that is centered around the viability of a child.

Good way is when legislators first allow the technology to proliferate to see how people use it, then they pass laws to deal with it. The bad way is to just force the tech under existing laws as the article is proposing. \n		\n		Yes, air conditioning has proliferated, but people treat it differently. A lot of people in their homes are very reluctant to use it regularly because of the electricity costs and because they prefer fresh air to  conditioned air. Businesses often use it as an attractor for customers. When we're talking about people in prison, maybe it can be a privilege for the prisoners who work more and follow the rules. But I think that pushing it to the level of a right is premature. If someday solar energy infrastructure is so widespread that electricity costs go down to $4 a month, maybe we can talk.\n			>Would you say at any point heat doesn't become a human right. Some extreme examples would be 110 heat index and someone with high blood pressure?\n				>That's where the question actually lies, doesn't it? If A/C isn't provided because of cost that is one thing, but if it's not provided in attempts to *harm* the prisoner that's probably where it potentially runs into an 8th amendment issue.\n				\n				If the judge who provided sentencing to the prisoner didn't outline or bare minimum expect that heat exhaustion would be used as punishment I think the prison could be running afoul.\n					>Well the 8th amendment is vague on purpose because you can't enumerate all the ways that it could be used correct? Can it be side steps by a cost argument? \n					\n					Shouldn't the government provide the basic needs to creat a liveable (not comfortable) environment while under their care.\n						>I only think cost could be used to sidestep it because it wouldn't be a *punishment* to the prisoner at that point, but instead would be an externality to the original punishment.\n						\n						That being said, I think there's considerable evidence that the lack of AC is used as a punishment in of itself. I personally don't see it any different than if the prison established a new policy of whipping the prisoners at 5pm every day, it's just a different form of extrajudicial punishment.\n							>I think our opinions on what the prison system should be differ wildly. But I appreciate you taking the time to explore this deeper with me so I can understand your point of view.\n					>> If A/C isn't provided because of cost that is one thing, but if it's not provided in attempts to harm the prisoner that's probably where it potentially runs into an 8th amendment issue.\n					\n					Even if the second reason is the underlying reason, it's easy to always claim that cost is the reason. A/C will always be more expensive than no A/C (unless medical costs skyrocket or the prison has to defend expensive lawsuits).\n						>Probably depends on the jury if we're going to be realistic here. There is tons of senators, representatives, and even wardens that outwardly exclaim that they don't *want* prisoners to have AC even when cost isn't considered.\n						\n						I doubt this could ever play out in courts with that being said, so many procedural issues connected to suing for this.\n				>[removed]\n					>I understand heating has been around for a long time I don't believe that's in question here.\n						>[removed]\n							>I didn't bring it up in this thread but I did bring it up in my original starter comments is that what you were referring to? \n							\n							In the story say at least 10 prisoners died because of heat should that not be a concern as well? At some point any temperature high or low can kill and if we're protecting against low temperatures why shouldn't we protect against ultra high temperatures?\n								>[removed]\n									>Sorry heat as in the outside temperature. I didn't make myself clear, I will correct that to help other out. Thanks\n			>\>Yes, air conditioning has proliferated, but people treat it differently. A lot of people in their homes are very reluctant to use it regularly because of the electricity costs and because they prefer fresh air to conditioned air.\n			\n			When it comes to heat this is indeed a right in a more traditional sense; a lot of states and municipalities have specific [disconnection notice](https://ncler.acl.gov/Files/Protecting-Older-Adults-from-Utility-Disconnection.aspx) laws for seniors w.r.t. heating. I don't see why cooling would be that different.\n			\n			And if we already acknowledge that it's less luxury and more fundamental for surviving or thriving in an environment, I don't see it as that much of a stretch to think it's something prisoners should have.\n			\n			\>because of the electricity costs\n			\n			I don't think there's many people who would say 'Yeah it's totally fair and great that some people can't afford air conditioning'. People make that argument for, like, iPhones and other 'millenial panic' luxuries, but AC has been around long enough, like you said, to thoroughly proliferate.\n				>I'll say that it's fair and great. In my opinion no one is entitled to anything. Not food, not clean water, nothing that a caveman wouldn't be entitled to. Everything else you earn. Or ask for. We can make it easier to earn, and more likely to say yes if you ask for it, but I think that it's more important to have a universal and perpetual principle of law than to have it creep based on technological advancement.\n					>\>In my opinion no one is entitled to anything.\n					\n					Depending on what you mean by entitled, I agree! I think that natural law arguments are appeals to the supernatural personally.\n					\n					\>Everything else you earn.\n					\n					'Earn' is a normative judgment that is largely based on opinion or personal morality.\n					\n					At the end of the day, if providing air conditioning to both the impoverished and prisoners produces better outcomes, then we should do it, IMO. I don't think that universal perpetual principles of law are very healthy for a society to have. Stability is great, but neither the universe nor human technological circumstance cares much for it, and it seems foolish to pretend otherwise.\n	>The Supreme Court has repeatedly, going up to Gorsuch in [Bucklew, 2019](https://harvardlawreview.org/2019/11/bucklew-v-precythe/) defined “unusual” in cruel and unusual to mean “long disused” or not customary. The court doesn’t consider if a punishment would be unusual to someone in 1791 — nor to someone in 1689, as the phrase “cruel and unusual” is just taken from the English Bill of Rights. \n	\n	In [Trop v. Dulles](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1956/70), the court ruled that the term unusual tied the eighth amendment to \n	\n	> evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\n	\n	Even Scalia, in [Harmelin v. Michigan](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/957/#tab-opinion-1958878) interpreted “unusual” to mean not “in common use” meaning common use today, not 1719.\n	\n	The current court finds that the death penalty to not be unusual, because it’s been a traditional punishment in common use going up to the present. However, by this standard, they might find lack of air conditioning to be unusual — it is unusual in the present day for government buildings to lack air conditioning.\n	>That’s like arguing that the First Amendment only applies to ye olde printing press and people shouting in the town square.\n	>When you're violating [international law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/teas-prisons-international-human-rights-standard-violations) you're doing something wrong.\n		>When some third-world country violates international law, they're doing something wrong.

People criticize other groups for being anti-science, then proceed to act anti-scientifically.\n	>> What am I missing here? Why are vaccinated people still bothering to wear masks, I might add?\n	\n	There are two reasons that, when taken into consideration, explain why.\n	\n	The vaccine is very effective, but not 100% effective. There are still instances of vaccinated people contracting COVID, though in all those cases the symptoms are mild and there have been no cases of a vaccinated person requiring hospitalization as a result.\n	\n	The point of masks is not to prevent the wearer from contracting COVID, but to prevent the wearer from spreading COVID. I'm not sure where the myth that the primary purpose of masks is to protect yourself came from but it's certainly a damaging myth.\n	\n	So because a vaccinated person can still carry COVID, and the primary purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent the wearer (in this scenario a vaccinated wearer) from spreading COVID, there's still a good reason for a vaccinated person to wear a mask.\n	\n	Personally, anecdotally, mask mandates in my area have been lifted.

Notably his list includes a Republican ask in requiring a form of Voter ID to vote.

Some states have vans that literally drive out to you if needed for example, others don't.\n			\n			And that is really the crux for many when it comes to Voter ID, most are for it, me included, but that means also making it easy/free to get one, regardless of your circumstances, and that means having programs that make sure that happens.\n		>Every state that requires one, also provides them for free to those who dont have one.  The complaint then becomes that people have to actually get documents and head over to a govt office. If you dont have those documents, they can even help with that.\n		\n		We really are kind of a laughingstock to the world in this regard.  The vast majority of countries require a photo ID to vote, dont have voting holidays, many dont even offer absentee ballots or make it very hard to get one, and other basic limits to safeguard voting.\n	>>Even with a more focused bill, the chances of attracting any meaningful Republican Support in the Senate to clear the filibuster threshold seems remote\n	\n	I agree. Even if the bill was literally just everything on that list, I don't see the GOP going for it. I think the main issue is the partisan gerrymandering piece. Like it or not, that is one of the advantages they have right now, and eliminating it harms them while leaving other forms of gerrymandering in place that currently benefits Democrats. \n	\n	Now if we keep partisan gerrymandering, or maybe give the courts a way to measure when it is too partisan, then that may be something that could work.\n		>When you refer to “other forms of gerrymandering which currently benefit democrats” what exactly are you referring to?\n			>Primarily majority minority districts.\n			>Maryland is a bit notorious for how gerrymandered it is.\n	>I like this list. I think wholeheartedly accepting the Voter ID ask would placate a few Republicans. IDK how many, but auto reg at the DMV passes the smell test much more than same-day, so it's hard to find a huge sticking point.\n	\n	Honestly, the biggest hurdle to attracting votes would be banning gerrymandering (depending on how porously the bill is written)...even if they don't say that part out loud.\n	>I've said this before but Manchin can't even get 10 Republicans to support reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, which used to be a formality. That being said, I would be fine trading a national voter ID in exchange for getting rid of partisan gerrymandering. I just can't see getting 10 Republican Senators to agree.\n	>>-Election Day Federal Holiday\n	\n	>-15 Days of Early Voting for Federal elections\n	\n	>-Banning Partisan Gerrymandering \n	\n	>-Automatic Voter Registration through the DMV\n	\n	>-Voter ID requirement\n	\n	>-Require outside advocacy groups who spend on Federal elections to disclose donors who give $10,000 or more during an election cycle\n	\n	That all seems reasonable to me. \n	\n	Which means it's not gonna pass.\n",1623872764.0,2,2,2,2
ModeratePolitics,t3_o196hl,h1ziyw2,">Last year, I started hearing talk of this 'Office 67', a particularly brutal officer when it came to protests. It was hard to know what to make of it given how much everyone involved was trying to distort coverage to their own narrative. However, it now appears that at least this one officer almost certainly went too far in how they dealt with protestors.\n	>So how far does someone need to go from being a 'protestor' to recognizing they're a rioter? One should ask how the police came to be involved in the first place.\n		>If you read the article one of the incidents pretty clearly doesn't involve protestors. Homeowner's home was filling with tear gas, goes out to talk to officer gets hit from behind in the back of the head by Kammerer.\n		>Someone who spits in front of the police is a protestor. Just because other people in the crowd were crossing the line into rioting doesn't give the police free reign to beat the shit out of peaceful (if rude) protestors and then lie about it.\n			>> Just because other people in the crowd were crossing the line into rioting doesn't give the police free reign to beat the shit out of peaceful (if rude) protestors and then lie about it.\n			\n			It does give the police the right to arrest those who are rioting though. \n			\n			Which brings up the follow-up question: \n			\n			Are you a 'peaceful protestor' if you're not personally rioting yourself, but you're deliberately preventing the police from apprehending those among you who are?\n			\n			I would argue that while it doesn't necessarily make that person a 'rioter', it does disqualify them from the innocence of being considered a 'peaceful protestor'.\n",1623862016.0,2,2,2,2
ModeratePolitics,t3_o1d91q,h206zw8,">Looks like the Federal Reserve has back tracked a bit on their inflation expectations although they still view the current inflation pressure is transitory and that much of the inflation growth is due to a bounce back from depressed activity levels in 2020. As the article says, this meeting does appear to have caused a drop on the stock market, although it is does appear to be a small one. At the time of this post, the DOW is down .6%. \n\nDoes this change the Biden admin's path forward on their spending plans?
