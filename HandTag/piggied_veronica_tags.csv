moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h15poei,">I honestly don't have an issue with this.  We often look for additional ways to punish prisoners and write it off as though they deserve whatever bad treatment they receive.  This just results in worse prison conditions and higher rates of recidivism.  The vast majority of people in prison are not abusing this system, they are using it to just get by and get things most people would consider as essentials.  \n\nThe article mentions 20 prisoners out of 129,000 that have large amounts.  That's about .015 percent, no i don't think this is a large or pressing issue.\n\nThe Justice department and BOP have different goals, I'm glad that the BOP is focused on their goal in this situation and not that of the Justice Dept. because that's how it should be.\n	>I see an issue in edge cases and feel a more moderate approach might be in order such as:\n	\n	* Cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n	* allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders. \n	* Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n	\n	I'm not worried about them but feel if it can be abused maybe we should have a bit more restrictions on them without an additional burden on the prisoner.\n		>It sounds more like there are a few exceptional cases and trying to find a solution for those few cases by painting it as a larger issue than it is.  Court orders already exist and are a valid way to enforce the judgements against prisoners.\n		\n		>cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n		\n		If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n		\n		>allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders.\n		\n		Sound like justifying violating the 4th amendment because the person is in prison.  They are already greatly limited in exercising their rights, but that doesn't excuse further abuses without a valid need when they are able to obtain a court order if needed.\n		\n		>Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n		\n		There's already limits on how much they can spend from these accounts.  Why more restrictions?  What is the problem that we are trying to solve here?\n			>Prisoners get shaken down and have their mail read. Why is looking at their financial activity less intrusive than throwing their mattress on the floor?\n				>Their cells are subject to inspection and searches due to the fact contraband could be physically concealed there.  Mail is inspected to check against smuggling contraband.  \n				\n				These are both safety issues to the prison and of the prisoners, how does their financial activity relate to physical safety?\n			>>If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n			\n			Well, if the accounts are shielded from things like child support or alimony orders, they could be an effective way to hide money and keep it from people legally entitled to it.\n				>Court orders are exist for this and are an effective tool.\n					>>	Federal prison inmates are keeping large sums of money — in some cases more than $100,000 each — in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders for things like child support, alimony or other debts, and not subject to the same scrutiny as accounts owned by non-incarcerated citizens, according to court documents and interviews.\n					\n					Literally the first paragraph of the article.\n",1623249865.0,2,-99,2,2
moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h15fsuz,">This is like a couple dozen dollars per prisoner on average right?\n\nFeels like a lot of money but there's also a lot of people in prison in the USA.\n	>No solid data is known about the average. Here is relevant information based on the story.\n	\n	>Within the Federal Bureau of Prisons system, which houses roughly 129,000 inmates in facilities throughout the United States, there are more than 20 inmate accounts holding more than $100,000 each for a total exceeding $3 million, a person familiar with the program told The Washington Post.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Sometimes the sources are known, such as inmates cashing out their 401(k) retirement accounts or receiving payments from insurance policies. In other cases, it is less clear how the prisoner has amassed such funds. \n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>According to the individual familiar with the program, one of the biggest account holders is a disgraced former doctor with more than $250,000, while a former member of the military serving a life sentence for murder has more than $200,000.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Most prisoner accounts have only small sums of money.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Inmates can buy snacks and other goods in a prison’s commissary, but may not spend more than $360 a month there. Prisoners can also pay to make a limited number of phone calls or send a limited number of emails, though some of the restrictions have been eased during the coronavirus pandemic. And prisoners can send up to $100 a day to other people or have the government issue U.S. Treasury checks for any amount from their prison accounts.\n",1623245561.0,2,-99,2,2
moderatepolitics,t3_nvuwvh,h159h8b,">Federal prison inmates do have a unique loophole. They can keep money in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders (child support, alimony, debts).\n\nThese accounts are not subject to criminal or regulatory scrutiny that could flag suspicious activity report because the agency is not considered a financial institution and does not run its bank transactions through a treasury department screening program.\n\nThe department of corrections says they have an [Inmate Financial Responsibility Program](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/BOP/e0023/intro.htm) that cannot force inmates to comply with state court orders but will incentivize them to do through privileges. The loophole in the Bureau of Prisons' policy is that they only accept federal court orders and not states.\n\nIn some cases, inmates were released from prison while the Justice Department was still trying to collect money. The Bureau of Prisons gave them debit cards with their account balances on them. The marshals had to track down the men to get their government-issued bank cards.\n\nA Tennessee bank robber asked a federal judge to order the $16,000 he owed in restitution to be taken from his prison account. A Bureau of Prisons staffer urged him not to pay the entire sum -- but rather to pay on a schedule of $100 a month (he would have paid off half of what was owed when he served his time)\n\nCongress has enacted a law that requires inmates to pay what they owe, but the Bureau of Prisons doesn't enforce that without specific court orders.\n\n*What is your thought about this type of arrangement?*\n\nIf you're **against it,** Why shouldn't inmates have money that they can spend for commentary, phone calls, etc. that would be protected from court orders?\n\nIf you're **for it**, Could a system like this be abused or even used as a bribery system for wealthy inmates?\n\n**On the fence**, what type of reform should we apply to this system?\n	>This seems kinda like a non-issue if the wealthiest prisoners (around 20) only have about 100K in their account. The issue with not protecting the little money they do have is in most prisons, prisoners are required to pay for a lot of their goods. If the state was allowed to zero out their accounts then they’d have no recourse because they wouldn’t be able to afford an attorney and they’d have no money to buy the goods they need.\n		>We agree that zeroing out their account is not something that should be done. That said, making this limitless system limited might allow a person to put money into a protected account while having excess money allow that be collectible. \n		\n		Doing away with excessive finds would be something I would be for but allowing sheltered bank accounts sounds like it could be ripe for abuse as well if you have enough money.\n			>Ripe for abuse is a non-concern when there are so many existing financial loopholes and non-compliance issues in use by people shielding much more than these 20 people's three million dollars.\n			\n			If we can use this as an excuse to get people with a hard-on for punitive justice on board to implement broad financial and tax reform in a way where actual loop holes and abuses are addressed, then I'm fine with this as rhetoric.\n			\n			Pretending it's a relevant existing issue that demands attention on its own is pretty silly though,  given those numbers.\n	>I think, as a side comment, there’s an argument for shielding prisoners from financial collections while they’re in custody, and sometime after. \n	\n	If the goal is rehabilitation, that cannot occur if someone is broke when they get out. Desperation is a motivation for some, but not all crimes - and while it’s no excuse, I would think that the social benefits of lower recidivism can outweigh the costs. \n	\n	I think of it similar to how collecting back rent from tenants is inherently difficult - the alternative is forcing people into homelessness, which has significantly higher societal costs.\n	>The article specifically references a Megan Bailey, in prison in Missouri on methamphetamine charges.\n	\n	I searches Missouri's court records, and found only Marijuana charges (and traffic violations) under that name. However, per the article:\n	\n	> Megan Bailey, a convicted methamphetamine dealer in Missouri, who was ordered to pay $250,000 as part of a 17-year prison sentence she received in 2019.\n	\n	It's possible Bailey was a drug 'kingpin', peddling large quantities and making large sums in the process. If that were the case, I'd expect to see at least local news articles. None such articles exist.\n	\n	What this tells me is this is *probably* (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure. Dealers typically make [~24,000 per year](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-07-11-9002260581-story.html) so the fine at least feels excessive.\n	\n	In situations like that one, allowing the state to take what little money she does have all but guarantees recidivism.\n	\n	So, even though the system could be (and most certainly is being) abused, until we take efforts to clean up the existing sentencing and fines structures, I have a hard time being angry about it.\n		>Be cautious using the lack of data as proof of anything other than you cannot find the data. I believe federal records are via PACER and not state websites as we are talking about a federal crime. (I'm not for sure.. if a Redditor with more info can reply to this comment that would be great)\n		\n		According to a website, I will not name (as it has her inmate number). Megan Bailey was incarcerated for Conspiracy to distribute Meth, Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime.\n		\n		While you're describing a separate problem (excessive fines) something we both agree and it is tangibly related. But the lack of regulation could have issues beyond excessive finds.  It also might be an invitation to use the money to bribe guards given the lack of safeguards on the money.\n			>250k is an absurd fine for distributing meth and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime.\n			\n			What did locking up Megan Bailey accomplish? There's still meth on the streets, it's extremely easy to get and very cheap. We've been locking up drug dealers under brutally harsh sentences for decades now and none of this has changed. \n			\n			The drug war is pointless cruelty.\n		>>What this tells me is this is probably (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure.\n		\n		What tells me this is probably *not* a relatively small crime is twofold:\n		\n		a) It's a federal incarceration and feds don't give a shit about low level street dealers that make minimum wage.\n		\n		b) The length of the sentence.  Federal sentencing is pretty straight forward - crimes are assigned base levels and there are modifiers that can add or subtract levels. Add up all the levels for all the crimes and you get a sentencing range.\n		\n		Receiving a 17 year sentence puts her between [levels 30 and 35](https://guidelines.ussc.gov/chapters/5/parts/A/sections) on the sentencing table depending on criminal history and other variables. To put that in perspective, there are only 43 levels total and the crime of trafficking methamphetamine of 12-30 **pounds** is a [level 34.](https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2018-guidelines-manual/2018-chapter-2-d)\n		\n		It probably wasn't just that and there were additional crimes like firearm possession.  But it's just not the case that this was your friendly dealer that lives down the hall at your dorm.\n			>[Apparently the median base level offense is a 32](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Methamphetamine_FY16.pdf) - which implies this person was at or near the median, plus the known possession of a firearm (+2). [Based on this](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-ut/legacy/2013/06/03/fedfacts%20for%20utah_web.pdf) the fine could be related to:\n			\n			> Unlawful for any person to place an advertisement in any newspaper,\n			magazine, handbill **or other publications** seeking or offering to illegally\n			receive, buy, or distribute any Schedule I controlled substance.\n			\n			Which carries a $250,000 fine. If I use an at-home printer to make an advert, and staple it to an electric pole - $250,000 fine.\n			\n			Hell, a business card could mean a $250,000 fine.\n				>>The median base offense level in these cases was 32. This corresponds to a quantity of drugs between 3.3 and 11.0 pounds of methamphetamine.\n				\n				Again, not a small crime.\n				\n				I find it pretty unlikely though that a drug trafficker at the level of moving pounds of meth was printing out advertisements at Office Depot and stapling them to telephone poles around the neighborhood.\n				\n				The reality is we have no idea why the fine was imposed, but the maximum fine for methamphetamine trafficking *by itself* is [$10 million.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30722.pdf)..  so Occam's Razor suggests it could simply have been for that.\n					>Per [this source](https://theconversation.com/most-us-drug-arrests-involve-a-gram-or-less-118440) using data from UC Davis Law Review, ~25% have more than 5 grams.\n					\n					These two aren't reconcilable. It cannot be the case that the median is < 5 grams and carries the penalty of ~7 lbs *unless* the median is skewed by non-drug-mass related characteristics.\n					\n					What those are is hard to tell, but the assertion that she was carrying 3.3 to 11 *pounds* doesn't comport with the statistics we have.\n						>The error you’re making is conflating federal drug prosecutions with all state and local drug prosecutions.\n",1623242365.0,2,-99,2,2
moderatepolitics,t3_nvgd2h,h13bl5i,">What is it with these blue states in New England, electing moderate red governors? IIRC, there was a post here recently about the Republican governor of Vermont. That’s my biggest unanswered question in this article.\n\nIn theory, it has the potential to prevent the state GOP from drifting too far to the right. Living in a red state where the state party often threatens to tar and feather the governor of its own party for not being Trumpy enough, I don’t know that it will work that way.\n	>Part of it has to do with open primaries. Something like 70% of massachusetts voters are registered as independent. Often people will vote for the candidate that they see as less bad of the opposition so it encourages more moderate candidates at the state level. Also there isn't the massive ideological divide in Massachusetts that there is in the rest of the country. Fiscally moderate and socially liberal describes a lot of people here. Also the fact that the largest religion group in mass Catholics tend to vote Democrat eats away at the support for a more socially conservative candidate. The state GOP as an organization might be behind Trump but there are enough moderates and liberals here that nominating a candidate that openly espouses Trump's views would hand the election to even the most boring democratic candidate\n	>I think it's more the other direction. Democrats have the run of our legislature, so people like to vote for Republicans in the Governorship to keep them in check. We don't really care much about the state GOP here, they're kind of a joke. Lyons is nuts if he thinks going full Trump is going to help them though.\n		>I mean it’s unfair to characterize him as a moderate republican. He’s really a moderate Democrat with an R next to his name. This article almost reads like the onion. “The GOP should take advice from the rights most liked politician by leftists”.\n		>Not exactly. The MA Democratic is not exactly known for being progressive; a lot of progressives and leftists have called out the party for being a corrupt establishment party that's interested in self-preservation. One only needs to look at the dirty tricks employed against Alex Morse to see how corrupt the state party is. \n		\n		https://newrepublic.com/article/161406/charlie-baker-massachusetts-democratic-party-failure\n			>Oh yeah, part of the reason is that informed voters don't trust the party for unilateral rule. The progressive thing is just what I hear as a reason that people say they voted R for Gov. Much of our more progressive stuff has come out of referendums and pressure from the public.\n	>They elect Republican governors because they balance the worse impulses of the Supra-majority legislatures.\n	>Is it really that unique?  \n	\n	While often blue, places like California, Massachusetts, Baltimore, Vermont, and New York have had Republican governors in relatively recent history.\n		>These guys wouldn't even be Republicans in, like, North Carolina.\n		>Ah yes, the good old state of Baltimore\n	>You'll get a lot of the 'balance' theories in response to that, but this implies and intentionality that I don't agree is there. The bottom line is that most of these 'blue states' aren't actually blue.\n	\n	For example, with Massachusetts, you can see [here](https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/03/19/massachusetts-past-election-results) that the state is split about 2:1 Democrat vs Republican, but there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n	\n	So in an environment where 1 out of every 3 voters are Republican to begin with, it only takes a few other factors to tip an election. Those factors could be (note that I don't know if these are true, but they seem to match the data):\n	\n	* Republicans tend to be older and thus more of them vote.\n	* Conservative Democrats are often turned off by the candidates that Democrats in that state nominate.\n	* The state has had a string of Republican governors that were widely respected, endorsing each other on the way out.\n	* The Republican party has focused its support on that race\n	* As speculated elsewhere in this post, people could prefer someone as executive that balances out the super-majority of Democrats in other branches.\n	\n	If any two of these are true it could be enough to push the race over the edge, but if I had to guess, I'd be willing to bet that most of them are true.\n		>> there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n		\n		The smaller ones do, and not very many.  On your list, the most populous district that leans red is Billerica at something like 30th place, population-wise.  Next one is Westfield, another 10 places down.  You can expect the smallest towns to vote conservative, but not many people live there.\n	>It's the people. They have an identity crisis. Have you been to Boston? Everyone is staunchly liberal but ridiculously conservative. They will preach about the good of homeless shelters but make sure to block any attempts to build one within 10 miles of them. They will promote racial equality but then only hire white people. They actually worked for years to shut down the only gay nightclub in Boston until they finally did it. However, then they are happy to march in a gay pride festival.\n	>The republican governor in Vermont implemented a race based (minority) vaccine schedule, and the called anyone who argues against it racist.\n",1623196535.0,2,-99,2,2

He’s a dying breed of northern liberal Republicans that have been leaving the GOP for ages, much like how traditional southern Democrats worked. Tbh these days he could easily pass for a more right wing Democrat.\n\nBut another thing that caught my eye was the increasingly Trumpification of state GOP organisations. They’re very intent about influencing the direction of the state GOPs even at the cost of losing power.\n	>Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts. As a resident of the state most people I talk to either like the guy or are ambivalent. There are definitely those who are open to fiscal conservatives amongst the younger generation as balancing the budget is a generally popular proposal. However anyone more socially to the right wouldn't have a path to state office. There does seem to be this almost libertarian bent around here no matter which side of the aisle you are on with a distrust of the power of the federal government in general. This state will elect whoever promises to pass a balanced budget and changes the status quo the least.\n		>> Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts.\n		\n		The article says that Mass. has been electing Republicans governors regularly for the last sixty years\n			>That's fair I should be probably said in this current political climate. I don't think anyone that is riding the current wave of trump populism would not have a shot in this state for instance. The man in your tag Ike would still be able to win in Massachusetts for example. But it requires a very moderate republican by today's standards to carry the state. Any hint of right of center social views generally loses you the election before it starts. Republicans win here by staying away from social issues entirely and promising to balance the budget and promote the states rights over the federal government. All of them have been generally popular here too with the exception of Romney at the end when he decided to spend the 2nd half of his term campaigning for president and handing the Democrats the seat on beacon hill.\n			>West Virginia had been electing Democratic governors regularly for the last several decades too but that doesn't mean Democrats really stood a good shot in 2020 or will in 2024.

Not much room for moderate Republicans anymore.\n			>Not just regularly, out of the past six governors going back to the early 90’s, five were Republican.

Little that remains are perpetually hounded by activists, journalists and their fellow elected officials. \n	\n	IMO, at state and local level, people will go back to voting for other parties. It is much easier to recognize the incompetence and corruption  at local level than at federal level.\n	>While the GOP is ahead in the race to the extremes, the Democrats are quietly moving as well.\n	\n	https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/four-democratic-incumbents-one-republican-ousted-in-virginia-house-primaries/ar-AAKQxCo?ocid=spartanntp\n	\n	If you notice, all the upsets went to extremists on both sides.
