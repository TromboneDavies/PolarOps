I am trying to find some unbiased opinions.\n	>Here's a report that describes the legal arguments used in Israeli courts, from a critical perspective. I think you can actually learn about both sides from this report even though it is biased.\n	\n	https://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files/sites/default/files2/201203_under_the_guise_of_legality_eng.pdf\n	\n	tl;dr Israel determines what land it can appropriate for settlements based on Ottoman-era regulations for 'land in which you cannot hear someone yelling from any nearby settlement' as well as other weird stuff\n		>I watched some videos on the history and I don't feelings about either side. I think most people think Israel is on one side and Palestine is on the other and they need to just leave each other alone but once you see the history and the current map I can only come to the conclusion the only way is just treat everyone equally and hope the younger generation is tired of fighting.\n			>> the only way is just treat everyone equally and hope the younger generation is tired of fighting.\n			\n			My understanding of Israeli law is that they heavily promote the [Law of Return.](https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/return.htm)  This law, which is central to the creation of Israel and determining its demographic makeup, clearly does not consider any other race or ethnicity other than Jewish to be significant.  The entire point is for Israel to be a Jewish state, not an 'equal' democracy between Jews and other groups such as the Palestinians.  Israel with this law is IMHO the clearest example that the tyranny of the majority is an ever-present burden for the minority.\n				>~20-25% of Israeli citizens aren't Jewish. Some Israelis are racists, only care about Jews, etc, sure, but they're a minority. The majority or vast majority consider non-Jews (Arabs, Druze, Palestinians, etc) that are citizens of Israel significant.\n				\n				> Israel with this law is IMHO the clearest example that the tyranny of the majority is an ever-present burden for the minority.\n				\n				Do you mean in the world, or within the context of Israel?\n				\n				Also, Israelis are not a monolith, and Israeli Jews are not a monolith. Here's a chart from recent elections: https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/EXT-MAGAZINE-israel-election-results-exit-polls-and-live-vote-count-updates-1.9647405 13 political parties had enough votes to get seats to potentially form a government (it's a parliamentary system). Some of these parties vary widely from each other - they're all across the political spectrum from far left to far right, secular to religious, capitalist to socialist, and everything in between. You ever heard the phrase 'Two Jews, three opinions'? Now apply that to a nation of over 9 million people, 75-80% of whom are Jewish. The various opinions of Israeli Jews isn't some narrow set of opinions. Now add in all the non-Jews, with opinions that overlap sometimes and diverge sometimes with the wide ranging opinions of Israeli Jews. Welcome to Israeli politics. It's amazing anything happens ever.\n",1621533062.0,-99,2,-99,2
neutralpolitics,t3_n4blmf,gwuo5g7,">Minnesotan here.  I'm not aware of anything in particular that our government is doing that is very different than any many other states.  What really is different, though, is our preexisting culture.  Whether its due to our Scandinavian roots or some other factor, we are a people that are pretty dedicated to doing right by our neighbors, and civically engaging.  For instance, we've had the highest voter turnout in every election going back as far as I can remember; In 2020 [we nearly hit 80%!](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/voter-turnout-by-state)  I'd really be interested in seeing if there was a correlation between voting rates and vaccine hesitancy, now that we're talking about it...\n	>There could be some correlation between the high voter turnout,  trust in institutions, and low vaccine hesitancy. \n	\n	One thing I'll add is that you should be skeptical of the data because it shows such strong state-line effects. Fargo, ND and Moorhead, MN have a combined MSA and you should expect there to be a much more smooth change in vaccine hesitancy.\n		>> One thing I'll add is that you should be skeptical of the data because it shows such strong state-line effects.\n		\n		That raised my eyebrow too: from [the methodology document](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265341/vaccine-hesitancy-COVID-19-Methodology.pdf), the underlying data is from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey which is used to estimate state-level vaccine hesitancy rates.  So those should be pretty robust.\n		\n		Then they used demographic data to see how vaccine hesitancy depends on each, and applied those to PUMA- and county-level demographic data.  Which I daresay still leaves the county-level estimates dominated by the state-level estimates, since while e.g. Cass County where Moorhead is has different American Community Survey (ACS) demographics to Minnesota as a whole, they're just not *that* different so you will only tend to get in-state variation as far as the demographics swing from county to county **and** the vaccine hesitancy varies between those demographics.\n		\n		Plus, political leanings are *not* among the demographics available via the ACS, while [there's a pretty strong correlation there.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html)\n		>I'd like to point out that with regards to the [hhs estimates](https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) there are some methodological quirks that make that map and the map [circulating yesterday by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/covid-herd-immunity-vaccine.html) potentially misleading. \n		\n		\n		[The methodology can be found here](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265341/vaccine-hesitancy-COVID-19-Methodology.pdf). \n		\n		These estimates of vaccine hesitancy were created using a logistic regresssion and used these measures as estimators: age, gender, race, education, marital status, health insurance status, income levels, **state**, with interaction between race and education level. \n		\n		State to me is odd because this gives very defined borders to states. Niaevely I'd assume since this issue has become somewhat polarized with dems (in general) being more likely to get the vaccine that this map should sort of mirror a population map with more dense populations wanting the vaccine with more rural areas not wanting/needing the vaccinee due to proximity. \n		\n		Going back to the variables it's basically MRP without the PUMA-level (Public Use Microdata Areas) effects or any real continuous effects at all. Leading to some really disjointed state lines. Because of the inclusion of state in the predictive model, I'm not even sure if this should be displayed at the county level or just at the state level. Add this to the releativly new and untested pulse data and I'm not sure this is useful at all.\n			>Yeah the model is clearly using state as a major factor in the estimate. If it wasn’t, you might see Minnesota being a low spot of vaccine hesitancy with it then increasing slowly as you expand but not such defined change at the border.\n	>The state-by-state 2020 voting eligible population-based turnout rate map can be had from [the Minnesota Secretary of State's website](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/media/4446/us-turnout-map-2020.pdf) for eyeballing purposes.\n	\n	R² = 0.15 across the 50 states + D.C., so there might be a little something there but not much.  [I just threw this together.](https://i.imgur.com/zMHy2HL.png)\n		>You are fantastic.\n	>We also did a particularly good job of getting people to fill out the census.\n		>[Minnesota dominated the self-responded percentage of households](https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates/nrfu.html) with 75.1% versus Washington which led the also-rans with 72.4%.

neutralpolitics,t3_n4blmf,gwvhrq4,">What's so special about MN though? VT and CA also have very low rates per your map. Is it just about the fact that MN is surrounded by other states with higher hesitancy rates? Perhaps party p reference has something to do with the correlation of hesitancy rates given how MN [voted in 2020 and the past elections](https://cookpolitical.com/2020-national-popular-vote-tracker)?\n	>That's mostly what I am trying to answer. I've never really spent time in MN before, and the contrast at the state border of MN is stark compared to the surrounding Wisconsin, Iowa, and the Dakotas. Are rural border counties in MN really that different than their surrounding states? Is the messaging different?\n		>Ok I actually have a little experience with this. I grew up in rural Minnesota, about 15 miles from the Iowa border, and yes, everything was very different when you crossed the border!! The roads, buildings, towns on the Iowa side look different. Everything in iowa looked... Dusty? Or old or something (sorry). Minnesota is a really weird place- we have a distinctive culture that is reflected in how our state governs, educates, everything. Minnesotans have a trust in government that our neighboring states do not. We pay more taxes and we are very aware of it, but we also get better *stuff* because of it. Even rural Republican Minnesotans know that. I think it's the trust issue, as well as a messaging issue.\n		>I guess the rural aspect is interesting because in your map you can see the rural areas remain quite low for hesitancy. Having spent quite a bit of time in MSP area as well as Milwaukee area for work trips, I felt that a lot of the liberal perceptions of MN probably come from how the city is, but I have to admit I'm a bit clueless about the rural regions.\n	>OP attends college in MN and is outsourcing a portion of their homework to reddit?\n		>I am (fortunately? unfortunately??) long past school.\n			>Heh. Gave it a shot.  \n			\n			Why MN then?\n				>The surrounding states in the NE with high vaccine willingness are still similar. Large areas of CA and WA have high vaccine willingness, but MN really stands out compared to its neighboring states. Why? What is happening in MN that makes the border counties of it more likely to take the vaccine compared to the rural border counties of SD, IA, and WI?\n",1620105806.0,-99,2,-99,2
neutralpolitics,t3_n4blmf,gwwh2jc,>I'm not sure the evidence indicates that we're hitting hesitancy yet here in MN. We've used just under 90% of the doses we've received. When that number starts climbing it's time to worry more.\n\nThere does appear to be some movement on getting out into under-served communities. The state's starting to do mobile vaccination clinics: [https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/bus.html](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/bus.html)\n\nThe smaller the hurdle to getting it the fewer people will choose not to.\n,1620133320.0,-99,3,-99,3
neutralpolitics,t3_n4blmf,gwunzfa,">To be frank, I'd be surprised if it's not because Minnesota is historically far more liberal than ND or Iowa, and likely the same with Wisconsin. I don't know why that is ultimately other than perhaps the DFL in Minnesota was more sympathetic to the needs of farmers in MN than the democratic parties were in neighboring states (that's a straight guess).  So really I suspect a lot of it is because of the seeming tendency for Trump supporting republicans to be hesitant about the vaccine, and people with such a political bent to be more common outside of MN than inside. \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html\n	>[Minnesota is more urban](https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/urban-pct-states) and that's a [major political division](https://www.governing.com/now/americas-ever-widening-urban-rural-political-divide.html).\n	\n	It could be very misleading to compare e.g. rural white North Dakotans with urban Black Twin Cities residents by looking at the averages over the entire states. At the very minimum OP's question needs to be predicated on comparing similar counties.\n		>Right but if you look at the HHS map provided in OP's submission, hesitancy is low across the entire state of Minnesota : visually it resembles California or Connecticut more than it does it's neighbors. \n		\n		At the same, based on your ISU link, Minnesota's population is 73.3%, which sits between Kansas and Louisiana and neither of them have hesitancy rates as low as Minnesota. \n		\n		I do agree that county by county situation examination would be interesting but there are clear state wide trends seen in Minnesota that aren't seen in the region.\n		\n		edit : I dug a bit deeper with the HHS map. [Traverse County has a population of 3.5k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traverse_County,_Minnesota) and 62.8% of voters voted for Trump in [2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Minnesota) yet according to the HHS map, the estimated vaccine hesitancy is 11%. While the HHS map is based on an estimate, the data in bucks larger trends, particularly the fact that self identified [Republicans](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/republicans-became-more-vaccine-hesitant-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfolded) are more hesitant to get vaccines\n",1620089242.0,-99,2,-99,2
neutralpolitics,t3_n4blmf,gwy37rb,">The discrepancy in border counties seems to be a factor of the HHS' analysis, [which states it is predictive and based partially on a logistic regression](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265341/vaccine-hesitancy-COVID-19-Methodology.pdf).\n\n> Our statistical analysis occurred in two steps. First, using the HPS, we used a logistic regression to analyze predictors of vaccine hesitancy using the following sociodemographic and geographic\ninformation: age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, health insurance status, household income, state of residence, and interaction terms between race/ethnicity and having a college degree. Second, we applied the regression coefficients from the HPS analysis to the data from the ACS to predict hesitancy rates for each ACS respondent ages 18 and older. We then averaged the predicted values by the appropriate unit of geography, using the ACS survey weights, to develop area-specific estimates of hesitancy rates.\n\nThat aside, here's an interesting piece for you /u/Autoxidation to quantify the cultural claims some made here yesterday.\n\nA [2013 study by Cambridge and U Texas Austin psychology researchers published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0034434.pdf) considered the possibiltiy of personality regionality in the United States. The study conducted cluster analyses of over 1.5 million individuals to idenitfy regional expression of the 'big five' personality traits. \n\nThe study posited that Americans with similar temperaments are so likely to live in the same areas that a map of the country can be divided into regions with distinct personalities.\n\nOf great interest to your question is the Appendix, 'Sample Sizes and Aggregate Personality Scores for Each State,' particularly the score for the trait of agreeableness:\n\n\n\n\nState | Agreeableness T-score \n---|----\nMinnesota | 61.6\nIowa | 56.6\nNorth Dakota | 52.4\nSouth Dakota | 56.7\nWisconsin | 57.8\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Agreeableness) (emphasis mine):\n\n> The agreeableness trait reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, and **willing to compromise their interests with others**. \n\nEyeballing the Appendix, it seems that agreeableness serves to deepen and perpetuate the dominant regional societal inertia.\n",1620161338.0,-99,3,-99,3
neutralpolitics,t3_n1k749,gwgapdm,">This is likely to depend on what they mean by 'targeting'.  If by targeting they're going to implement a marketing campaign or set of marketing campaigns in areas with high representation of those demographics, or enact most policy changes that don't include filtering or quotas by racial reporting this may not be problematic at all from a ['strict scrutiny'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny) perspective.\n\nIf by targeting they mean they're going to implement some sort of racial quota directed at increasing the representation of historically disadvantaged groups, then this may be running directly into the strict scrutiny ruling and will very likely face legal challenges.\n\nI strongly suspect the first case though.  It's simple, you can minimize costs and it's very easy to show you did it without enacting any real change whatsoever.  This is a very attractive prospect to politicians with very low risk.  If there's a noticeable impact you claim that you affected the change, if nothing happens you use it as a platform to show how the evil $otherguys caused you to fail.  We see this time and again with politics.\n\nThis is amplified by the opposition to this which provides an easily blamed scapegoat if the project fails and that very scapegoat is usually the opposing political party, who is very eager to claim responsibility in order to appease their own followers.\n\nIf someone has more details on what they've stated they will do with respect to 'targeting' we can probably provide a better response.  I can find a lot stating that targeting happens, that they do it, and that there's a ton of these loans in Oklahoma but I'm not really able to find details on how they do the targeting.\n	>Actually, it is who gets priority to get their farm loans completely paid off and forgiven.

(https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny)  This would be due to supreme court case 'Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adarand_Constructors,_Inc._v._Pe%C3%B1a) which holds 'All racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local government actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under a standard of 'strict scrutiny,' the highest level of Supreme Court review (such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests).' It is also potentially worth noting Supreme Court case 'City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Richmond_v._J.A._Croson_Co.) which holds 'Racial quotas for awarding government contracts are not justified by general statistical evidence of inequality. The city did not investigate any race-neutral methods to correct the imbalance, and its 30% goal did not correspond to any actual measured injury.
