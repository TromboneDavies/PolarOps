politics,t3_obqgn6,h3pdgvv,">What is a miscarriage of justice is for a DA to publicly state he doesn't have enough evidence to convict him, try him civilly with no 5th Amendment protection, and then use what he says at that trial against him criminally.

Here’s the thing: In Pennsylvania, a prosecutor needs to ask the court for permission to officially grant immunity from prosecution. Castor never did.

See 42 Pa.C.S. §5947. But contrary to\n		what the courts below concluded, this statute is irrelevant in this case because it pertains\n		to witnesses whose assistance is sought to testify against other defendants, not for\n		procuring testimony from defendants themselves. See id. at §5947(b)(1) (permitting\n		prosecutors to seek immunity where “the testimony or other information from a witness\n		may be necessary to the public interest”) (emphasis added).\n		\n		That isn't some gotcha that is being found that the court didn't consider. \n		\n		https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-100-2020cdo%20-%20104821740139246932.pdf\n",1625160223.0

But he didn’t.*\n		>From the PA S.C Opinion: \n		\n		> 2\n		Indeed, where a prosecutor seeks an immunity order for a witness, Pennsylvania’s\n		immunity statute contemplates judicial approval. See 42 Pa.C.S. §5947. But contrary to\n		what the courts below concluded, this statute is irrelevant in this case because it pertains\n		to witnesses whose assistance is sought to testify against other defendants, not for\n		procuring testimony from defendants themselves. See id. at §5947(b)(1) (permitting\n		prosecutors to seek immunity where “the testimony or other information from a witness\n		may be necessary to the public interest”) (emphasis added).\n		\n		That isn't some gotcha that is being found that the court didn't consider. \n		\n		https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-100-2020cdo%20-%20104821740139246932.pdf\n		>Oh ok - well as long as it’s technically legal I guess it’s fine that a prosecutor can just lie?\n			>Cosby's lawyers could have petitioned a judge for an immunity deal.

You can’t have prosecutors making deals and reneging on them to deprive defendants of their fifth amendment rights.  To hold otherwise created bad precedent.\n\nYes — this is a bad result.

See 42 Pa.C.S. §5947. But contrary to\n		what the courts below concluded, this statute is irrelevant in this case because it pertains\n		to witnesses whose assistance is sought to testify against other defendants, not for\n		procuring testimony from defendants themselves.
