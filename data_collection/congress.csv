I know, complaining and whining gets us no where.\n\nBut your recommendation simply wouldn't be needed if the government wasn't running poorly.\n	>The 25th is necessary without regard to how well the government and states are working. I think it came about after JFK was assassinated and some people began to wonder what would have happened if he had survived but was completely unable to function because of the nature of his injuries.  LBJ would not have been sworn in because JFK was technically alive, and that would be a problem.\n	\n	The 25th Amendment has four sections in it. \n	\n	Section 1 says VP become POTUS if POTUS dies. \n	\n	Section 2 says that if the office of the VP becomes vacant, POTUS gets to appoint the new VP subject to confirmation of both houses of Congress.\n	\n	Section 3 deals with a POTUS voluntarily transferring power to VP due to incapacity. The incapacity can be temporary. Section 3 has been used before—George W. Bush transferred power to Cheney temporarily because Bush was about to have a colonoscopy and Bush would be sedated during the procedure. When Bush woke up and the anesthesia had worn off, Bush reclaimed the presidential powers.\n	\n	Section 4 deals with involuntary transfer of power to VP. It has never been used, and this is the Section that OP is talking about. \n	\n	OP is advocating that someone like the Speaker of the House be able to suggest that POTUS is incapacitated if there effectively is no VP around to do so. OP provides examples where there is no VP because of death or vacancy of office, or the VP has become incapacitated.  I think everyone can easily agree when a VP position is vacant or a VP is dead.\n	\n	But in the examples where a VP has merely become incapacitated—from medical reasons like injury or illness, or from situations where communication has been lost [missing but not confirmed dead from a plane crash, or unable to communicate because of evacuation], I think there could be disagreement among government officials about how incapacitated a VP is or is not. \n	\n	Because of this possibility and to avoid any confusion, I would want any amendment to the 25th Amendment to also address who gets to declare that a VP is incapacitated for the purpose of authorizing the Speaker of the House to invoke the 25th Amendment regarding POTUS. \n	\n	Also, I’d want it to be clear that if a Speaker of the House becomes Acting President because the VP was missing/incapacitated at the time the 25th was invoked, then the VP becomes Acting President automatically as soon as he/she regains consciousness or says, “Hey guys, I’m over here—I survived the plane crash and am perfectly fine.” At that point, the VP, as Acting President could confirm that the elected POTUS is indeed incapacitated (still in a coma, perhaps) or the VP/Acting President could declare that the elected POTUS is not incapacitated and POTUS becomes POTUS again.\n",1610692851.0,3

The number of seats on a committee that a party gets is proportional to the number of seats they hold in the chamber. Party leadership decides who serves where. Members can apply to be assigned to a certain committee if they have some sort of professional experience in that area, but professional experience alone does not guarantee them a seat. Seats on the more powerful and influential committees are reserved for the most well-connected members who are able to raise more money for the party. Members spend upwards of 40 hours each week in party-owned call centers across the street from the Capitol making fundraising phone calls for their party's congressional campaign fund. The funds they raise are jokingly called 'party dues.' The more 'dues' a congressman can raise the more powerful committee assignments they're given. Once leadership makes the assignments they are voted on by the party caucus (mostly a formality-you don't question the leadership) and eventually voted on by the full chamber (again, more of a formality).\n\nTL;DR: experience means nothing. The more time a member spends fundraising the more likely they are to have an influential committee assignment.\n	>That was very depressing to read.\n	\n	Thanks for answering, though. Do you have a source?\n		>[This article from USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/25/lawmaker-dues-party-extortion-team-effort/84819738/) contains people both confirming and denying the claim that committee seats are assigned based on dues. The dues can either be paid out of personal reelection accounts or by asking people to donate to the campaign committees directly (from the call center). I'll let you decide who is telling the truth.\n		\n		[This one from 60 minutes](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-are-members-of-congress-becoming-telemarketers/) talks about the fundraising call centers. \n			>Thanks.\n",1486609274.0,10

No one is 'lining their pockets' - you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how COLAs work.\n\nThe COLA is is calculated by a formula included in the Social Security Act, ['based on increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).'](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/latestCOLA.html)\n\nNo Member of Congress determines the COLA, it is automatically determined by the price of commodities. In short, individuals collecting social security only get a COLA if the average CPI-W for the third quarter of a given year is higher than the average CPI-W for the third quarter of the previous year. That difference, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, is the COLA. \n	>The problem is the formula used to calculate it is based on a 30-something year old still in the working world.. which means the formula gets two things wrong.  The price of gas matters less to the elderly and disabled because we're not commuting to a job every day any more so when the price of gas drops it lowers their COLA.  Second, they're basing the cost of medications on that which a 30-something year old needs not a 70-something or disabled person needs.  \n	\n	They need to adjust the formula, Elizabeth Warren was talking about it last October/November when the COLA wasn't raised at all.  Now the COLA is going up at such a snails pace people are going to average what? 4-8 bucks more a month?  And then the cost of medicare is going up a couple bucks to then offset that. \n	\n	None of this touches the fact that rents are still going up, electric bills are going up, gas bills are going up (like for stoves/heating/laundry dryers)... \n	\n	There needs to be a change in the formula. It shouldn't be based on Urban Wage Earners/Clerical Workers because obviously those people's needs are different than elderly and disabled people. \n		>And if that's the argument you want to make, that's fine. But that isn't what you said. You asked which Members of Congress control how a COLA is calculated, and the answer is none of them.\n			>Well then I phrased it wrong, which Members of Congress Control the formula that's used to calculate the COLA? \n				>Again - none of them do. The formula that's used to calculate the COLA is set in law. It has been for years. No one controls it. That's like asking who controls that formula that decides how old you have to be to start drinking. \n				\n				The only way to change it would be to pass a law that amends the previous law containing the formula. Any Member of Congress can introduce a bill to do so. \n					>Ok then. \n	>'Lining their pockets' was the wrong term, what I really meant to get at is, the GOP wants to show the program as a failure, so they'll do what they can to make it seem less than what it is.  They have a vested interest in it's failure, that and Medicare.

(Photo: putneypics/flickr/cc)\n\nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Senate on Wednesday defeated a proposal by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would have spurred the purchase and installation of 10 million solar panel systems for homes and businesses nationwide over the next decade.\n\nSanders's amendment, which he said would have generated enough power to replace one-fifth of the nation’s coal-fired power plants, was attached to the Keystone XL legislation just passed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nWith the backing of Vermont's largest power company, Green Mountain Power, the amendment called for a 15 percent rebate for the purchase of photovoltaic systems.\n\nThe amendment got 40 votes.\n\nIt needed 60 to pass.\n\n'The scientific community tells us very clearly if we're going to reverse climate change and the great dangers it poses for the planet we must move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy,' Sanders said in a press release.\n\n'So if you're interested in reversing the dangers of climate change and creating jobs, I would urge you to support this amendment.'\n\nMore amendments were debated on Thursday, followed by the final Senate vote on the bill to approve the pipeline.\n\nThe U.S. House already passed its own Keystone XL legislation. President Barack Obama has vowed to veto the bill if it gets to his desk.\n\nOn Thursday, the SUN DAY Campaign—a non-profit research and educational organization that promotes sustainable energy technologies as cost-effective alternatives to nuclear power and fossil fuels—noted that renewable energy sources, namely solar and wind power, cumulatively provided more new electric generating capacity in 2014 than did natural gas.\n\nAnd according to RenewableEnergyWorld.com, the U.S. is on pace to complete its one millionth installation in 2015. \n\nThis follows a 36 percent increase in solar PV installations in 2014.\n\nhttp://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/01/29/eve-kxl-vote-gop-senate-rejects-sanders-national-solar-expansion-plan\n",1422574489.0,11

Mary Landrieu (D-La.) to add the vote to her list of accomplishments heading into a tough runoff election. \n\nFifty-nine senators voted for the bill, one short of the 60 needed to clear a filibuster. Fourteen Democrats joined all the Senate Republicans in voting for the bill, which was cosponsored by Landrieu and John Hoeven (R-N.D.). \n\nThe House passed companion legislation on Friday from Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Landrieu's opponent in the runoff election.\n\nLandrieu said going into Tuesday's debate that it was 'one of the first debates I've been in in eight years where the outcome is uncertain.' \n\nShe added, however, that she went into the debate 'knowing in my heart we have 60 votes. I hope we've got the courage that supports that.'\n\nBut that last vote never materialized. \n\nSeveral Democrats considered swing votes confirmed in the days leading up to the vote that they would be voting against the bill. And on Tuesday afternoon, Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, announced that he was voting 'no' on the measure. King had previously said he was 'leaning no.' \n\nHis was among the last uncertain votes in the Senate.\n\n'Congress is not -- nor should it be -- in the business of legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project,' King said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. \n\n'And while I am frustrated that the President has refused to make a decision on the future of the pipeline, I don’t believe that short-circuiting the process to circumvent his Administration is in the best interest of the American people.'\n\nEnvironmental advocates also tried to put pressure on a pair of Democrats who had decided to vote for the bill, Sens. Tom Carper (Del.) and Michael Bennet (Colo.). \n\nCapitol Police arrested four young activists who staged a protest in Carper's office, singing refrains like 'Stop the pipeline, stop the greed.' Three others were arrested at Bennet's office.\n\nDebate on the bill lasted six hours, with supporters of the bill criticizing the lengthy evaluation process that has now lasted six years. \n\n'This process has not worked,' said Heidi Heitkamp (D-Neb.). 'This process has not brought this project to some kind of finality.'\n\nCritics of the pipeline also took to the floor to defend their votes against the bill. \n\n'From my state's point of view, it's all harm,' said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).\n\nThe failure averts a showdown with President Obama, for now. \n\nWhile the president never issued a direct veto threat, he strongly implied in a press conference last Friday that he would reject the bill if it came to his desk. \n\n'My position hasn’t changed, that this is a process that is supposed to be followed,' he said.\n\nBut legislation to force approval of the pipeline will likely make a comeback as soon as the new Congress is sworn in in January, when a bill will have more supporters in the Senate. \n\n'Republicans are committed to getting Keystone approved,' said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on the Senate floor. \n\nIf not today, McConnell said, 'then a new majority after the beginning of the year will be taking this up and sending it down to the desk of the president.'\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/senate-keystone-vote_n_6181050.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\n",1416354979.0,11

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) offered a full-throated defense of the government’s collection of data on billions of American phone calls, saying Wednesday that the National Security Agency’s practices have safeguarded the nation without trampling on civil liberties.\n“What keeps me up at night, candidly, is another attack against the United States. And I see enough of the threat stream to know that is possible,” Feinstein said at a Pacific Council on International Policy dinner in Century City.\nApparently that same heartfelt “full-throated defense” of government spying overreach ‘safeguarding the nation’ does not apply to herself and her committee, however.\n\nIn response to Feinstein’s hypocritical outrage at being targeted by the intelligence community, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Michigan) sent this message out on his official Facebook page:\n\nShe has had no problem with U.S. intelligence agencies, like the ‪#‎NSA‬, violating the Constitution by spying on hundreds of millions of Americans without probable cause. This kind of hypocrisy is one of the biggest reasons the public can’t stand Congress.\nExactly.\n\nIt’s one of a plethora of reasons, but still. At least someone up on that hill gets it…\n\nFormer NSA Contractor Edward Snowden also came out a few hours ago to say that Feinstein is a total hypocrite.\n\nThe only person that does not seem to realize it by now is, sadly, Sen. Feinstein. \n\nhttp://www.activistpost.com/2014/03/rep-amash-to-sen-feinstein-hypocrites.html\n",1394578709.0,11

Currently there is no immediate punishment to Representatives or Senators when they fail to work together to provide a bill that supports continuous government to the people of the United States. \n\nWhile services are shutdown, all Americans are potentially impacted and hundreds of thousands of families who rely on their income for service to the federal government are in danger of their livelihood when their pay is jeopardized.\n\nAs such there should be a punitive incentive for Congress to ensure that they are motivated to never allow political differences to be used to cause a lapse in service or a danger to their workers.  Congress should be fined hourly when their malfeasance results in not providing a bill to fund services which results in a shutdown of the federal government.\n\nThis punitive fine should be immediate upon their failure to provie a bill with results in government shutdown, incremental and significant.  This would be an immediate fine of 10% of their annual pay upon shutdown and it should recur hourly until it a bill is presented to the President.  This will ensure that they are duly incentivized to prevent a shutdown and to work diligently throughout the entire shutdown to resolve it.  If the President vetoes the bill during a government shutdown, the President shall be fined for the same number of hours of shutdown as the Congress, and the hourly fines shall continue until a bill is presented and signed.\n",1380757169.0,12

Most of them that have been there have forgotten there. Those who haven't forgotten there will be more than happy to serve for minimum wage for the privilege of service. If they're not, let them go home and be local politicians and business leaders. Many people these days seem to feel they'd be better off without a Congress. Let us give these offices forbearance and some motivation to stop being a national embarrassment. Should they fail, then perhaps we should write in the generic name of the original legislator. At best, perhaps the original legislator will show up. At worst, we get rid of the bums who make our form of government wholly inefficient and non-competitive. If Congress people cannot live on minimum wage or refuse to, then let them raise it and let every man and woman who wants a job have one.
